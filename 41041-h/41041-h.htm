<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>For material used in this volume the
author is largely in the debt of the
librarians of the State Libraries of
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois. From the Honorable C. B.
Galbreath, of the Ohio State Library, he
has received much assistance covering an
extended period. To the late Thomas B.
Searight&rsquo;s valuable collection of biographical
and colloquial sketches, <i>The Old Pike</i>,
the author wishes to express his great
indebtedness. As Mr. Searight gave special
attention to the road in Pennsylvania, the
present monograph deals at large with the
story of the road west of the Ohio River,
especially in the state of Ohio.</p>

<p>The Cumberland Road was best known
in some parts as the &ldquo;United States&rdquo; or
&ldquo;National&rdquo; Road. Its legal name has
been selected as the most appropriate for
the present monograph which is revised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>from a study of the subject <i>The Old National
Road</i> formerly published by the Ohio State
Arch&aelig;ological and Historical Society.</p>

<h3>OUR FIRST NATIONAL ROAD</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>The middle ages had their wars and agonies, but
also their intense delights. Their gold was dashed
with blood, but ours is sprinkled with dust. Their
life was intermingled with white and purple; ours is
one seamless stuff of brown.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ruskin.</span></p>


<p>A person cannot live in the American
Central West and be acquainted
with the generation which greets the
new century with feeble hand and dimmed
eye, without realizing that there has been a
time which, compared with today, seems
as the Middle Ages did to the England for
which Ruskin wrote&mdash;when &ldquo;life was
intermingled with white and purple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This western boy, born to a feeble republic-mother,
with exceeding suffering in
those days which &ldquo;tried men&rsquo;s souls,&rdquo;
grew up as all boys grow up. For a long
and doubtful period the young West grew
slowly and changed appearance gradually.
Then, suddenly, it started from its slum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>bering,
and, in two decades, could hardly
have been recognized as the infant which,
in 1787, looked forward to a precarious and
doubtful future. The boy has grown into
the man in the century, but the changes of
the last half century are not, perhaps, so
marked as those of the first, when a wilderness
was suddenly transformed into a number
of imperial commonwealths.</p>

<p>When this West was in its teens and
began suddenly outstripping itself, to the
marvel of the world, one of the momentous
factors in its progress was the building of
a great national road, from the Potomac
River to the Mississippi River, by the
United States Government&mdash;a highway
seven hundred miles in length, at a cost of
seven millions of treasure. This ribbon of
road, winding its way through Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois,
toward the Mississippi, was one of the
most important steps in that movement of
national expansion which followed the
conquest of the West. It is probably
impossible for us to realize fully what it
meant to this West when that vanguard of
surveyors came down the western slopes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the Alleghenies, hewing a thoroughfare
which should, in one generation, bind distant
and half-acquainted states together in
bonds of common interest, sympathy, and
ambition. Until that day, travelers spoke
of &ldquo;going into&rdquo; and &ldquo;coming out of&rdquo; the
West as though it were a Mammoth Cave.
Such were the herculean difficulties of
travel that it was commonly said, despite
the dangers of life in the unconquered land,
if pioneers could live to get into the West,
nothing could, thereafter, daunt them.
The growth and prosperity of the West
was impossible, until the dawning of such
convictions as those which made the Cumberland
Road a reality.</p>

<p>The history of this famed road is but a
continuation of the story of the Washington
and Braddock roads, through Great Meadows
from the Potomac to the Ohio. As
outlined in Volumes III and IV of this
series, this national highway was the
realization of the youth Washington&rsquo;s early
dream&mdash;a dream that was, throughout his
life, a dominant force.</p>

<p>But Braddock&rsquo;s Road was for three score
years the only route westward through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
southwestern Pennsylvania, and it grew
worse and worse with each year&rsquo;s travel.
Indeed, the more northerly route, marked
out in part by General Forbes in 1758, was
plainly the preferable road for travelers to
Pittsburg until the building of the Cumberland
Road, 1811-1818.</p>

<p>The rapid peopling of the state of Ohio,
and the promise of an equal development
in Indiana and Illinois caused the building
of our first and only great national road.
Congress passed an act on the thirtieth of
April, 1802, enabling the people of Ohio to
form a state government and seek admission
into the Union. Section seven contained
the following provision:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one-twentieth of the net proceeds
of the lands lying within said State sold
by Congress shall be applied to the laying
out and making public roads leading from
the navigable waters emptying into the
Atlantic, to the Ohio, to the said state, and
through the same, such roads to be laid
out under the authority of Congress, with
the consent of the several states through
which the roads shall pass.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>On the third of March, 1803 another act
was passed which appropriated three of the
five per cent to laying out roads in the state
of Ohio, the remaining two per cent to be
devoted to building a road from navigable
waters leading into the Atlantic Ocean, to
the Ohio River contiguous to the state of
Ohio. A committee was appointed to
review the matter and the conclusion of
their report to the Senate on the nineteenth
of December, 1805 was as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore the committee have thought
it expedient to recommend the laying out
and making a road from Cumberland, on
the northerly bank of the Potomac, and
within the state of Maryland, to the Ohio
river, at the most convenient place on the
easterly bank of said river, opposite to
Steubenville, and the mouth of Grave
Creek, which empties into said river, Ohio,
a little below Wheeling in Virginia, This
route will meet and accommodate roads
from Baltimore and the District of Columbia;
it will cross the Monongahela at or
near Brownsville, sometimes called Redstone,
where the advantage of boating can
be taken; and from the point where it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
probably intersect the river Ohio, there are
now roads, or they can easily be made over
feasible and proper ground, to and through
the principal population of the state of
Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Immediately the following act of Congress
was passed, authorizing the laying
out and making of the Cumberland Road:</p>

<p class="center">AN ACT TO REGULATE THE LAYING OUT AND
MAKING A ROAD FROM CUMBERLAND,<br />
IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND, TO THE STATE
OF OHIO</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> &nbsp; <i>Be it enacted by the Senate
and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That
the President of the United States be, and
he is hereby authorized to appoint, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate,
three discreet and disinterested citizens of
the United States, to lay out a road from
Cumberland, or a point on the northern
bank of the river Potomac, in the state of
Maryland, between Cumberland and the
place where the main road leading from
Gwynn&rsquo;s to Winchester, in Virginia, crosses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the river, to the state of Ohio; whose duty
it shall be, as soon as may be, after their
appointment, to repair to Cumberland aforesaid,
and view the ground, from the points
on the river Potomac hereinbefore designated
to the river Ohio; and to lay out in
such direction as they shall judge, under
all circumstances the most proper, a road
from thence to the river Ohio, to strike the
same at the most convenient place, between
a point on its eastern bank, opposite to the
northern boundary of Steubenville, in said
state of Ohio, and the mouth of Grave
Creek, which empties into the said river a
little below Wheeling, in Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> &nbsp;  And be it further enacted, That
the aforesaid road shall be laid out four
rods in width, and designated on each side
by a plain and distinguishable mark on a
tree, or by the erection of a stake or monument
sufficiently conspicuous, in every
quarter of a mile of the distance at least,
where the road pursues a straight course so
far or further, and on each side, at every
point where an angle occurs in its course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span>  &nbsp; And be it further enacted, That
the commissioners shall, as soon as may be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
after they have laid out said road, as aforesaid,
present to the President an accurate
plan of the same, with its several courses
and distances, accompanied by a written
report of their proceedings, describing the
marks and monuments by which the road
is designated, and the face of the country
over which it passes, and pointing out the
particular parts which they shall judge require
the most and immediate attention and
amelioration, and the probable expense of
making the same possible in the most difficult
parts, and through the whole distance;
designating the state or states through
which said road has been laid out, and the
length of the several parts which are laid
out on new ground, as well as the length
of those parts laid out on the road now
traveled. Which report the President is
hereby authorized to accept or reject, in the
whole or in part. If he accepts, he is hereby
further authorized and requested to pursue
such measures, as in his opinion shall
be proper, to obtain consent for making the
road, of the state or states through which
the same has been laid out. Which consent
being obtained, he is further authorized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to take prompt and effectual measures to
cause said road to be made through the
whole distance, or in any part or parts of
the same as he shall judge most conducive
to the public good, having reference to the
sum appropriated for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span>  &nbsp; And be it further enacted, That
all parts of the road which the President
shall direct to be made, in case the trees
are standing, shall be cleared the whole
width of four rods; and the road shall be
raised in the middle of the carriage-way
with stone, earth, or gravel or sand, or a
combination of some or all of them, leaving
or making, as the case may be, a ditch or
water course on each side and contiguous
to said carriage-way, and in no instance
shall there be an elevation in said road,
when finished, greater than an angle of
five degrees with the horizon. But the
manner of making said road, in every
other particular, is left to the direction of
the President.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> &nbsp;  And be it further enacted, That
said commissioners shall each receive four
dollars per day, while employed as aforesaid,
in full for their compensation, includ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ing
all expenses. And they are hereby
authorized to employ one surveyor, two
chainmen and one marker, for whose faithfulness
and accuracy they, the said commissioners,
shall be responsible, to attend
them in laying out said road, who shall
receive in full satisfaction for their wages,
including all expenses, the surveyor, three
dollars per day, and each chainman and
marker, one dollar per day, while they shall
be employed in said business, of which
fact a certificate signed by said commissioners
shall be deemed sufficient evidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 6.</span> &nbsp;  And be it further enacted, That
the sum of thirty thousand dollars be, and
the same is hereby appropriated, to defray
the expenses of laying out and making said
road. And the President is hereby authorized
to draw, from time to time, on the
treasury for such parts, or at any one time,
for the whole of said sum, as he shall judge
the service requires. Which sum of thirty
thousand dollars shall be paid, first, out of
the fund of two per cent reserved for laying
out and making roads to the state of Ohio,
and by virtue of the seventh section of an
act passed on the thirtieth day of April,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
one thousand eight hundred and two, entitled,
&ldquo;An act to enable the people of the
eastern division of the territory northwest
of the river Ohio to form a constitution
and state government, and for the admission
of such state into the Union on an
equal footing with the original states, and
for other purposes.&rdquo; Three per cent of the
appropriation contained in said seventh section
being directed by a subsequent law to
the laying out, opening, and making roads
within the said state of Ohio; and secondly,
out of any money in the treasury not otherwise
appropriated, chargeable upon, and
reimbursable at the treasury by said fund
of two per cent as the same shall accrue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 7.</span> &nbsp;  And be it further enacted, That
the President be, and he is hereby requested,
to cause to be laid before Congress, as soon
as convenience will permit, after the commencement
of each session, a statement of
the proceedings under this act, that Congress
may be enabled to adopt such further
measures as may from time to time be
proper under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>Approved March 29, 1806.</p>
<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Th. Jefferson.</span></p>

<p><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>President Jefferson appointed Thomas
Moore of Maryland, Joseph Kerr of Ohio,
and Eli Williams of Maryland commissioners.
Their first report was presented
December 30, 1806, as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The commissioners, acting by appointment
under the law of Congress, entitled,
&lsquo;An act to regulate the laying out and
making a road from Cumberland in the
State of Maryland, to the State of Ohio,&rsquo;
beg leave to report to the President of the
United States, and to premise that the
duties imposed by the law became a work
of greater magnitude, and a task much
more arduous, than was conceived before
entering upon it; from which circumstance
the commissioners did not allow themselves
sufficient time for the performance of it
before the severity of the weather obliged
them to retire from it, which was the case
in the first week of the present month
(December). That, not having fully accomplished
their work, they are unable fully
to report a discharge of all the duties
enjoined by the law; but as the most material
and principal part has been performed,
and as a communication of the progress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
already made may be useful and proper,
during the present session of Congress, and
of the Legislatures of those States through
which the route passes, the commissioners
respectfully state that at a very early period
it was conceived that the maps of the country
were not sufficiently accurate to afford
a minute knowledge of the true courses
between the extreme points on the rivers,
by which the researches of the commissioners
were to be governed; a survey for
that purpose became indispensable, and
considerations of public economy suggested
the propriety of making this survey precede
the personal attendance of the commissioners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Josias Thompson, a surveyor of professional
merit, was taken into service and
authorized to employ two chain carriers
and a marker, as well as one vaneman, and
a packhorse-man and horse, on public
account; the latter being indispensable and
really beneficial in accelerating the work.
The surveyor&rsquo;s instructions are contained
in document No. 1, accompanying this
report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calculating on a reasonable time for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the performance of the instructions to the
surveyor, the commissioners, by correspondence,
fixed on the first day of September
last, for their meeting at Cumberland to
proceed in the work; neither of them,
however, reached that place until the third
of that month, on which day they all met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The surveyor having, under his instructions,
laid down a plat of his work, showing
the meanders of the Potomac and Ohio
rivers, within the limits prescribed for the
commissioners, as also the road between
those rivers, which is commonly traveled
from Cumberland to Charleston, in part
called Braddock&rsquo;s road; and the same being
produced to the commissioners, whereby
straight lines and their true courses were
shown between the extreme points on each
river, and the boundaries which limit the
powers of the commissioners being thereby
ascertained, serving as a basis whereon to
proceed in the examination of the grounds
and face of the country; the commissioners
thus prepared commenced the business of
exploring; and in this it was considered
that a faithful discharge of the discretionary
powers vested by the law made it necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to view the whole to be able to judge of a
preference due to any part of the grounds,
which imposed a task of examining a space
comprehending upwards of two thousand
square miles; a task rendered still more
incumbent by the solicitude and importunities
of the inhabitants of every part of the
district, who severally conceived their
grounds entitled to a preference. It
becoming necessary, in the interim, to run
various lines of experiment for ascertaining
the geographical position of several points
entitled to attention, and the service suffering
great delay for want of another surveyor,
it was thought consistent with the
public interest to employ, in that capacity,
Arthur Rider, the vaneman, who had been
chosen with qualification to meet such an
emergency; and whose services as vaneman
could then be dispensed with. He commenced,
as surveyor, on the 22nd day of
September, and continued so at field work
until the first day of December, when he
was retained as a necessary assistant to the
principal surveyor, in copying field notes
and hastening the draught of the work to
be reported.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The proceedings of the commissioners
are especially detailed in their general
journal, compiled from the daily journal
of each commissioner, to which they beg
leave to refer, under mark No. 2.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a careful and critical examination
of all the grounds within the limits prescribed,
as well as the grounds and ways
out from the Ohio westwardly, at several
points, and examining the shoal parts of
the Ohio river as detailed in the table of
soundings, stated in their journal, and after
gaining all the information, geographical,
general and special, possible and necessary,
toward a judicial discharge of the duties
assigned them, the commissioners repaired
to Cumberland to examine and compare
their notes and journals, and determine
upon the direction and location of their
route.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this consultation the governing
objects were:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; Shortness of distance between navigable
points on the eastern and western
waters.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;  A point on the Monongahela best
calculated to equalize the advantages of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
this portage in the country within reach
of it.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;  A point on the Ohio river most capable
of combining certainty of navigation
with road accommodation; embracing, in
this estimate, remote points westwardly,
as well as present and probable population
on the north and south.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;  Best mode of diffusing benefits with
least distance of road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In contemplating these objects, due
attention was paid as well to the comparative
merits of towns, establishments and
settlements already made, as to the capacity
of the country with the present and
probable population.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the course of arrangement, and in
its order, the first point located for the
route was determined and fixed at Cumberland,
a decision founded on propriety, and
in some measure on necessity, from the
circumstance of a high and difficult mountain,
called Nobley, laying and confining
the east margin of the Potomac, so as to
render it impossible of access on that side
without immense expense, at any point
between Cumberland and where the road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
from Winchester to Gwynn&rsquo;s crosses, and
even there the Nobley mountain is crossed
with much difficulty and hazard. And this
upper point was taxed with another formidable
objection; it was found that a high
range of mountains, called Dan&rsquo;s, stretching
across from Gwynn&rsquo;s to the Potomac,
above this point, precluded the opportunity
of extending a route from this point in a
proper direction, and left no alternative but
passing by Gwynn&rsquo;s; the distance from
Cumberland to Gwynn&rsquo;s being upward of a
mile less than from the upper point, which
lies ten miles by water above Cumberland,
the commissioners were not permitted to
hesitate in preferring a point which shortens
the portage, as well as the Potomac
navigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The point of the Potomac being viewed
as a great repository of produce, which a
good road will bring from the west of
Laurel Hill, and the advantages which
Cumberland, as a town, has in that respect
over an unimproved place, are additional
considerations operating forcibly in favor
of the place preferred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In extending the route from Cumber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>land,
a triple range of mountains, stretching
across from Jening&rsquo;s run in measure
with Gwynn&rsquo;s, left only the alternative of
laying the road up Will&rsquo;s creek for three
miles, nearly at right angles with the true
course, and then by way of Jening&rsquo;s run,
or extending it over a break in the smallest
mountain, on a better course by Gwynn&rsquo;s,
to the top of Savage mountain; the latter
was adopted, being the shortest, and will
be less expensive in hill-side digging over
a sloped route than the former, requiring
one bridge over Will&rsquo;s creek and several
over Jening&rsquo;s run, both very wide and considerable
streams in high water; and a
more weighty reason for preferring the
route by Gwynn&rsquo;s is the great accommodation
it will afford travelers from Winchester
by the upper point, who could not reach
the route by Jening&rsquo;s run short of the top
of Savage, which would withhold from
them the benefit of an easy way up the
mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, however, supposed that those who
travel from Winchester by way of the upper
point to Gwynn&rsquo;s, are in that respect more
the dupes of common prejudice than judges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of their own ease, as it is believed the way
will be as short, and on much better
ground, to cross the Potomac below the confluence
of the north and south branches
(thereby crossing these two, as well as Patterson&rsquo;s
creek, in one stream, equally fordable
in the same season), than to pass
through Cumberland to Gwynn&rsquo;s. Of these
grounds, however, the commissioners do
not speak from actual view, but consider it
a subject well worthy of future investigation.
Having gained the top of Alleghany
mountain, or rather the top of that part
called Savage, by way of Gwynn&rsquo;s, the
general route, as it respects the most important
points, was determined as follows, viz:</p>

<p>&ldquo;From a stone at the corner of lot No.
1, in Cumberland, near the confluence of
Will&rsquo;s creek and the north branch of the
Potomac river; thence extending along the
street westwardly, to cross the hill lying
between Cumberland and Gwynn&rsquo;s, at the
gap where Braddock&rsquo;s road passes it; thence
near Gwynn&rsquo;s and Jesse Tomlinson&rsquo;s, to
cross the big Youghiogheny near the mouth
of Roger&rsquo;s run, between the crossing of
Braddock&rsquo;s road and the confluence of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
streams which form the Turkey foot;
thence to cross Laurel Hill near the forks
of Dunbar&rsquo;s run, to the west foot of that
hill, at a point near where Braddock&rsquo;s old
road reached it, near Gist&rsquo;s old place, now
Colonel Isaac Meason&rsquo;s, thence through
Brownsville and Bridgeport, to cross the
Monongahela river below Josias Crawfords&rsquo;
ferry; and thence on as straight a course
as the country will admit to the Ohio,
at a point between the mouth of Wheeling
creek and the lower point of Wheeling
island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this direction of the route it will lay
about twenty-four and a half miles in Maryland,
seventy-five miles and a half in
Pennsylvania, and twelve miles in Virginia;
distances which will be in a small degree
increased by meanders, which the bed of
the road must necessarily make between
the points mentioned in the location; and
this route, it is believed, comprehends more
important advantages than could be afforded
in any other, inasmuch as it has a capacity
at least equal to any other in extending
advantages of a highway; and at the same
time establishes the shortest portage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
between the points already navigated, and
on the way accommodates other and nearer
points to which navigation may be extended,
and still shorten the portage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It intersects Big Youghiogheny at the
nearest point from Cumberland, then lies
nearly parallel with that river for the distance
of twenty miles, and at the west foot
of Laurel Hill lies within five miles of
Connellsville, from which the Youghiogheny
is navigated; and in the same
direction the route intersects at Brownsville,
the nearest point on the Monongahela river
within the district.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The improvement of the Youghiogheny
navigation is a subject of too much importance
to remain long neglected; and the
capacity of that river, as high up as the falls
(twelve miles above Connellsville), is said
to be equal, at a small expense, with the
parts already navigated below. The
obstructions at the falls, and a rocky rapid
near Turkey Foot, constitute the principal
impediments in that river to the intersection
of the route, and as much higher as
the stream has a capacity for navigation;
and these difficulties will doubtless be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
removed when the intercourse shall warrant
the measure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under these circumstances the portage
may be thus stated: From Cumberland to
Monongahela, sixty-six and one-half miles.
From Cumberland to a point in measure
with Connellsville, on the Youghiogheny
river, fifty-one and one-half miles. From
Cumberland to a point in measure with the
lower end of the falls of Youghiogheny,
which will lie two miles north of the public
road, forty-three miles. From Cumberland
to the intersection of the route with the
Youghiogheny river, thirty-four miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is here said of the Little
Youghiogheny, which lies nearer Cumberland;
the stream being unusually crooked,
its navigation can only become the work of
a redundant population.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The point which this route locates, at
the west foot of Laurel Hill, having cleared
the whole of the Alleghany mountain, is so
situated as to extend the advantages of an
easy way through the great barrier, with
more equal justice to the best parts of the
country between Laurel Hill and the Ohio.
Lines from this point to Pittsburg and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Morgan town, diverging nearly at the same
angle, open upon equal terms to all parts of
the western country that can make use of
this portage; and which may include the
settlements from Pittsburg, up Big Beaver
to the Connecticut reserve, on Lake Erie,
as well as those on the southern borders of
the Ohio and all the intermediate country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brownsville is nearly equidistant from
Big Beaver and Fishing creek, and equally
convenient to all the crossing places on the
Ohio, between these extremes. As a port,
it is at least equal to any on the Monongahela
within the limits, and holds superior
advantages in furnishing supplies to emigrants,
traders, and other travelers by land
or water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unmindful of the claims of towns
and their capacity of reciprocating advantages
on public roads, the commissioners
were not insensible of the disadvantage
which Uniontown must feel from the want
of that accommodation which a more southwardly
direction of the route would have
afforded; but as that could not take place
without a relinquishment of the shortest
passage, considerations of public benefit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
could not yield to feelings of minor import.
Uniontown being the seat of justice for
Fayette county, Pennsylvania, is not without
a share of public benefits, and may
partake of the advantages of this portage
upon equal terms with Connellsville, a
growing town, with the advantage of
respectable water-works adjoining, in the
manufactory of flour and iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After reaching the nearest navigation
on the western waters, at a point best calculated
to diffuse the benefits of a great
highway, in the greatest possible latitude
east of the Ohio, it was considered that, to
fulfill the objects of the law, it remained
for the commissioners to give such a direction
to the road as would best secure a
certainty of navigation on the Ohio at all
seasons, combining, as far as possible, the
inland accommodation of remote points
westwardly. It was found that the obstructions
in the Ohio, within the limits between
Steubenville and Grave creek, lay principally
above the town and mouth of Wheeling;
a circumstance ascertained by the
commissioners in their examination of the
channel, as well as by common usage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
which has long given a decided preference
to Wheeling as a place of embarkation and
port of departure in dry seasons. It was
also seen that Wheeling lay in a line from
Brownsville to the centre of the state of
Ohio and Post Vincennes. These circumstances
favoring and corresponding with
the chief objects in view in this last direction
of the route, and the ground from
Wheeling westwardly being known of equal
fitness with any other way out from the
river, it was thought most proper, under
these several considerations, to locate the
point mentioned below the mouth of
Wheeling. In taking this point in preference
to one higher up and in the town of
Wheeling, the public benefit and convenience
were consulted, inasmuch as the present
crossing place over the Ohio from the
town is so contrived and confined as to
subject passengers to extraordinary ferriage
and delay, by entering and clearing a
ferry-boat on each side of Wheeling island,
which lies before the town and precludes
the opportunity of fording when the river
is crossed in that way, above and below the
island. From the point located, a safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
crossing is afforded at the lower point of
the island by a ferry in high, and a good
ford at low water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The face of the country within the
limits prescribed is generally very uneven,
and in many places broken by a succession
of high mountains and deep hollows, too
formidable to be reduced within five degrees
of the horizon, but by crossing them
obliquely, a mode which, although it imposes
a heavy task of hill-side digging,
obviates generally the necessity of reducing
hills and filling hollows, which, on these
grounds, would be an attempt truly quixotic.
This inequality of the surface is not
confined to the Alleghany mountain; the
country between the Monongahela and Ohio
rivers, although less elevated, is not better
adapted for the bed of a road, being filled
with impediments of hills and hollows,
which present considerable difficulties, and
wants that super-abundance and convenience
of stone found in the mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The indirect course of the road now
traveled, and the frequent elevations and
depressions which occur, that exceed the
limits of the law, preclude the possibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of occupying it in any extent without great
sacrifice of distance, and forbid the use of it,
in any one part for more than half a mile, or
more than two or three miles in the whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The expense of rendering the road now
in contemplation passable, may, therefore,
amount to a larger sum than may have
been supposed necessary, under an idea of
embracing in it a considerable part of the
old road; but it is believed that the contrary
will be found most correct, and that a sum
sufficient to open the new could not be
expended on the same distance of the old
road with equal benefit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sum required for the road in contemplation
will depend on the style and
manner of making it; as a common road
cannot remove the difficulties which always
exist on deep grounds, and particularly in
wet seasons, and as nothing short of a firm,
substantial, well-formed, stone-capped road
can remove the causes which led to the
measure of improvement, or render the
institution as commodious as a great and
growing intercourse appears to require, the
expense of such a road next becomes the
subject of inquiry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In this inquiry the commissioners can
only form an estimate by recurring to the
experience of Pennsylvania and Maryland
in the business of artificial roads. Upon
this data, and a comparison of the grounds
and proximity of the materials for covering,
there are reasons for belief that, on the
route reported, a complete road may be
made at an expense not exceeding six thousand
dollars per mile, exclusive of bridges
over the principal streams on the way.
The average expense of the Lancaster, as
well as Baltimore and Frederick turnpike,
is considerably higher; but it is believed
that the convenient supply of stone which
the mountain affords will, on those grounds,
reduce the expense to the rate here stated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the policy of incurring this
expense, it is not the province of the commissioners
to declare; but they cannot,
however, withhold assurances of a firm
belief that the purse of the nation cannot be
more seasonably opened, or more happily
applied, than in promoting the speedy and
effectual establishment of a great and easy
road on the way contemplated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the discharge of all these duties, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
commissioners have been actuated by an
ardent desire to render the institution as
useful and commodious as possible; and,
impressed with a strong sense of the necessity
which urges the speedy establishment
of the road, they have to regret the circumstances
which delay the completion of the
part assigned them. They, however, in
some measure, content themselves with the
reflection that it will not retard the progress
of the work, as the opening of the road
cannot commence before spring, and may
then begin with making the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The extra expense incident to the
service from the necessity (and propriety,
as it relates to public economy,) of employing
men not provided for by law will, it is
hoped, be recognized and provision made
for the payment of that and similar
expenses, when in future it may be indispensably
incurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The commissioners having engaged in
a service in which their zeal did not permit
them to calculate the difference between
their pay and the expense to which the
service subjected them, cannot suppose it
the wish or intention of the government to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
accept of their services for a mere indemnification
of their expense of subsistence,
which will be very much the case under the
present allowance; they, therefore, allow
themselves to hope and expect that measures
will be taken to provide such further
compensation as may, under all circumstances,
be thought neither profuse nor
parsimonious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The painful anxiety manifested by the
inhabitants of the district explored, and
their general desire to know the route
determined on, suggested the measure of
promulgation, which, after some deliberation,
was agreed on by way of circular
letter, which has been forwarded to those
persons to whom precaution was useful,
and afterward sent to one of the presses in
that quarter for publication, in the form of
the document No. 3, which accompanies
this report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All which is, with due deference, submitted.</p>

<p>Starting from Cumberland the general
alignment of Braddock&rsquo;s Road was pursued,
until the point was reached where the old
thoroughfare left the old portage trail, on
the summit of Laurel Hill. The course
was then laid straight toward Brownsville
(Redstone Old Fort) probably along the
general alignment of the old Indian portage
path, and an earlier road. From Brownsville
to Washington was an old road, possibly
the course of the Indian trail.</p>

<p>As has already been suggested, there
was a dispute concerning the point where
the road would touch the Ohio River. The
rivalry was most intense between Wheeling
and Steubenville. Wheeling won through
the influence of Henry Clay, to whom a
monument was erected at a later date near
the town on the old road. The commissioners
rendered a second report on the
fifteenth of January, 1808 as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The undersigned, commissioners appointed
under the law of the United States,
entitled &lsquo;An act to regulate the laying out
and making a road from Cumberland, in
the State of Maryland, to the State of
Ohio,&rsquo; in addition to the communications<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
heretofore made, beg leave further to
report to the President of the United States,
that, by the delay of the answer of the
Legislature of Pennsylvania to the application
for permission to pass the road through
that state, the commissioners could not
proceed to the business of the road in the
spring before vegetation had so far advanced
as to render the work of exploring and
surveying difficult and tedious, from which
circumstance it was postponed till the last
autumn, when the business was again
resumed. That, in obedience to the special
instructions given them, the route heretofore
reported has been so changed as to
pass through Uniontown, and that they
have completed the location, gradation,
and marking of the route from Cumberland
to Brownsville, Bridgeport, and the Monongahela
river, agreeably to a plat of the
courses, distances and grades in which is
described the marks and monuments by
which the route is designated, and which
is herewith exhibited; that by this plat and
measurement it will appear (when compared
with the road now traveled) there is
a saving of four miles of distance between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Cumberland and Brownsville on the new
route.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the gradation of the surface of the
route (which became necessary) is ascertained
the comparative elevation and
depression of different points on the route,
and taking a point ten feet above the surface
of low water in the Potomac river at
Cumberland, as the horizon, the most
prominent points are found to be elevated
as follows, viz.:</p>

new route could not be made to occupy any
part of it (except an intersection on Wills<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
mountain, another at Jesse Tomlinson&rsquo;s,
and a third near Big Youghiogheny, embracing
not a mile of distance in the whole)
without unnecessary sacrifices of distances
and expense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, therefore, an estimate must be
made on the route as passing wholly
through new grounds. In doing this the
commissioners feel great difficulty, as they
cannot, with any degree of precision, estimate
the expense of making it merely
passable; nor can they allow themselves to
suppose that a less breadth than that mentioned
in the law was to be taken into the
calculation. The rugged deformity of the
grounds rendered it impossible to lay a
route within the grade limited by law
otherwise than by ascending and descending
the hills obliquely, by which circumstance
a great proportion of the route
occupies the sides of the hills, which
cannot be safely passed on a road of common
breadth, and where it will, in the
opinion of the commissioners, be necessary,
by digging, to give the proper form of
thirty feet, at least in the breadth of the
road, to afford suitable security in passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
on a way to be frequently crowded with
wagons moving in opposite directions, with
transports of emigrant families, and droves
of cattle, hogs, etc., on the way to market.
Considering, therefore, that a road on those
grounds must have sufficient breadth to
afford ways and water courses, and satisfied
that nothing short of well constructed and
completely finished conduits can insure it
against injuries, which must otherwise
render it impassable at every change of the
seasons, by heavy falls of rain or melting
of the beds of snow, with which the country
is frequently covered; the commissioners
beg leave to say, that, in a former report,
they estimated the expense of a road on
these grounds, when properly shaped,
made and finished in the style of a stone-covered
turnpike, at $6,000 per mile, exclusive
of bridges over the principal streams
on the way; and that with all the information
they have since been able to collect,
they have no reason to make any alteration
in that estimate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The contracts authorized by, and which
have been taken under the superintendence
of the commissioner, Thomas Moore (dupli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>cates
of which accompany this report), will
show what has been undertaken relative to
clearing the timber and brush from part of
the breadth of the road. The performance
of these contracts was in such forwardness
on the 1st instant as leaves no doubt of
their being completely fulfilled by the first
of March.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The commissioners further state, that,
to aid them in the extension of their route,
they ran and marked a straight line from
the crossing-place on the Monongahela, to
Wheeling, and had progressed twenty
miles, with their usual and necessary lines
of experiment, in ascertaining the shortest
and best connection of practical grounds,
when the approach of winter and the shortness
of the days afforded no expectation
that they could complete the location
without a needless expense in the most
inclement season of the year. And, presuming
that the postponement of the remaining
part till the ensuing spring would
produce no delay in the business of making
the road, they were induced to retire from
it for the present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great length of time already em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>ployed
in this business makes it proper for
the commissioners to observe that, in order
to connect the best grounds with that
circumspection which the importance of the
duties confided to them demanded, it
became indispensably necessary to run
lines of experiment and reference in various
directions, which exceed an average of four
times the distance located for the route,
and that, through a country so irregularly
broken, and crowded with very thick underwood
in many places, the work has been
found so incalculably tedious that, without
an adequate idea of the difficulty, it is not
easy to reconcile the delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is proper to mention that an imperious
call from the private concerns of Commissioner
Joseph Kerr, compelled him to
return home on the 29th of November,
which will account for the want of his signature
to this report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of which is, with due deference,
submitted, this 15th day of January, 1808.</p>

<p>It was necessary to obtain permission of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
each state through which the Cumberland
Road was to be built; Pennsylvania, only,
made any condition, hers being that the

Uniontown.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The first contracts were let on the
eleventh and the sixteenth of April, 1811,
for building the first ten miles west of
Cumberland, Maryland. These contracts
were completed in the year following.
More were let in 1812, 1813, and 1815; and
two years later contracts for all the distance
to Uniontown, Pennsylvania were let. In
1818, United States Mail coaches were
running between Washington, D. C. and
Wheeling, Virginia. The cost of the road
averaged $9,745 per mile between Cumberland
and Uniontown, and $13,000 per mile
for the entire division from the Potomac to
the Ohio. Too liberal contracts is the
reason given for the heavy expense between
Uniontown and Wheeling.</p>

<p>A flood of traffic swept over the great
highway immediately upon its completion. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
early as the year 1822 it is recorded
that a single one of the five commission
houses at Wheeling unloaded one thousand
and eighty-one wagons, averaging three
thousand five hundred pounds each, and
paid for freightage of goods the sum of
ninety thousand dollars.</p>

<p>But the road was hardly completed when
a specter of constitutional cavil arose,
threatening its existence. In 1822 a bill
was passed by Congress looking toward the
preservation and repair of the newly-built
road. It should be stated that the roadbed,
though completed in one sense, was
not in condition to be used extensively
unless continually repaired. In many
places only a single layer of broken stone
had been laid, and, with the volume of
traffic which was daily passing over it, the
road did not promise to remain in good
condition. In order to secure funds for the
constant repairs necessary, this bill ordered
the establishment of turnpikes with gates
and tolls. The bill was immediately vetoed
by President Monroe on the ground that
Congress, according to his interpretation
of the constitution, did not have the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to pass such a sweeping measure of internal
improvement.</p>

<p>The President based his conclusion upon
the following grounds, stated in a special
message to Congress, dated May 4, 1822:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A power to establish turnpikes, with
gates and tolls and to enforce the collection
of the tolls by penalties, implies a power to
adopt and execute a complete system of
internal improvements. A right to impose
duties to be paid by all persons passing a
certain road, and on horses and carriages,
as is done by this bill, involves the right
to take the land from the proprietor on a
valuation, and to pass laws for the protection
of the road from injuries; and if it
exist, as to one road, it exists as to any
other, and to as many roads as Congress
may think proper to establish. A right to
legislate for the others is a complete right
of jurisdiction and sovereignty for all the
purposes of internal improvement, and not
merely the right of applying money under
the power vested in Congress to make
appropriations (under which power, with
the consent of the states through which the
road passes, the work was originally com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>menced,
and has been so far executed). I
am of the opinion that Congress does not
possess this power&mdash;that the states individually
cannot grant it; for, although they
may assent to the appropriation of money
within their limits for such purposes, they
can grant no power of jurisdiction of sovereignty,
by special compacts with the
United States. This power can be granted
only by an amendment to the constitution,
and in the mode prescribed by it. If the
power exist, it must be either because it
has been specially granted to the United
States, or that it is incidental to some
power, which has been specifically granted.
It has never been contended that the power
was specifically granted. It is claimed only
as being incidental to some one or more of
the powers which are specifically granted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The following are the powers from which
it is said to be derived: (1) From the right
to establish post offices and post roads; (2)
from the right to declare war; (3) to regulate
commerce; (4) to pay the debts and
provide for the common defense and the
general welfare; (5) from the power to
make all laws necessary and proper for car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>rying
into execution all the powers vested
by the constitution in the government of
the United States, or in any department or
officer thereof; (6) and lastly from the
power to dispose of and make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the territory
and other property of the United
States. According to my judgment it cannot
be derived from either of these powers,
nor from all of them united, and in consequence
it does not exist.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>During the early years of this century,
the subject of internal improvements relative
to the building of roads and canals
was one of the foremost political questions
of the day. No sooner were the debts of
the Revolutionary War paid, and a surplus
accumulated, than a systematic improvement
of the country was undertaken. The
Cumberland Road was but one of several
roads projected by the general Government.
Through the administrations of Adams,
Jefferson, and Madison large appropriations
had been made for numerous improvements.
The bill authorizing the levying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of tolls was a step too far, as President
Monroe held that it was one thing to make
appropriations for public improvements,
but an entirely different thing to assume
jurisdiction and sovereignty over the land
whereon those improvements were made.
This was one of the great public questions
in the first half of the present century.
President Jackson&rsquo;s course was not very
consistent. Before his election he voted
for internal improvements, even advocating
subscriptions by the Government to the
stock of private canal companies, and the
formation of roads beginning and ending
within the limits of certain states. In his
message at the opening of the first congress
after his accession, he suggested the division
of the surplus revenue among the
states, as a substitute for the promotion of
internal improvements by the general Government,
attempting a limitation and
distinction too difficult and important to be
settled and acted upon on the judgment of
one man, namely, the distinction between
general and local objects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pleas of the advocates of internal
improvement,&rdquo; wrote a contemporary au<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>thority
of high standing on economic questions,
&ldquo;are these: That very extensive
public works, designed for the benefit of the
whole Union, and carried through vast
portions of its area, must be accomplished.
That an object so essential ought not to be
left at the mercy of such an accident as the
cordial agreement of the requisite number
of states, to carry such works forward to
their completion; that the surplus funds
accruing from the whole nation cannot be
as well employed as in promoting works in
which the whole nation will be benefited;
and that as the interests of the majority
have hitherto upheld Congress in the use
of this power, it may be assumed to be the
will of the majority that Congress should
continue to exercise it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The answer is that it is inexpedient to
put a vast and increasing patronage into
the hands of the general Government; that
only a very superficial knowledge can be
looked for in members of Congress as to
the necessity or value of works proposed to
be instituted in any parts of the states,
from the impossibility or undesirableness
of equalizing the amount of appropriation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
made to each; that useless works would be
proposed from the spirit of competition or
individual interest; and that corruption,
co&euml;xtensive with the increase of power,
would deprave the functions of the general
Government.... To an impartial observer
it appears that Congress has no
constitutional right to devote the public
funds to internal improvements, at its own
unrestricted will and pleasure; that the
permitted usurpation of the power for so
long a time indicates that some degree of
such power in the hands of the general Government
is desirable and necessary; that
such power should be granted through an
amendment of the constitution, by the
methods therein provided; that, in the
meantime, it is perilous that the instrument
should be strained for the support of any
function, however desirable its exercise
may be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In case of the proposed addition being
made to the constitution, arrangements will,
of course, be entered into for determining
the principles by which general are to be
distinguished from local objects or whether
such distinction can, on any principle, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
fixed; for testing the utility of proposed
objects; for checking extravagant expenditure,
jobbing, and corrupt patronage; in
short, the powers of Congress will be
specified, here as in other matters, by
express permission and prohibition.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In 1824, however, President Monroe
found an excuse to sign a bill which was very
similar to that vetoed in 1822, and the great
road, whose fate had hung for two years
in the balance, received needed appropriations.
The travel over the road in the first
decade after its completion was heavy, and
before a decade had passed the roadbed
was in wretched condition. It was the plan
of the friends of the road, when they realized
that no revenue could be raised by
means of tolls by the Government, to have
the road placed in a state of good repair by
the Government and then turned over to
the several states through which it passed.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The liberality of the government, at this
juncture, in instituting thorough repairs on
the road, was an act worthy of the road&rsquo;s
service and destiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illo_065.jpg" width="800" height="545" alt="Chestnut Ridge, Pennsylvania" title="" />
<span class="caption">Chestnut Ridge, Pennsylvania</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to insure efficiency and permanency
these repairs<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> were made on the
Macadam system; that is to say, the pavement
of the old road was entirely broken
up, and the stones removed from the road;
the bed was then raked smooth, and made
nearly flat, having a rise of not more than
three inches from the side to the center in
a road thirty feet wide; the ditches on each
side of the road, and the drains leading
from them, were so constructed that the
water could not stand at a higher level
than eighteen inches below the lowest part
of the surface of the road; and, in all cases,
when it was practicable, the drains were
adjusted in such manner as to lead the
water entirely from the side ditches. The
culverts were cleared out, and so adjusted
as to allow the free passage of all water
that tended to cross the road.</p>

<p>Having thus formed the bed of the road,
cleaned out the ditches and culverts, and
adjusted the side drains, the stone was
reduced to a size not exceeding four ounces
in weight, was spread on with shovels, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
raked smooth. The old material was used
when it was of sufficient hardness, and no
clay or sand was allowed to be mixed with
the stone.</p>

<p>In replacing the covering of stone, it was
found best to lay it on in layers of about
three inches thick, admitting the travel for
a short interval on each layer, and interposing
such obstructions from time to time
as would insure an equal travel over every
portion of the road; care being taken to
keep persons in constant attendance to rake
the surface when it became uneven by the
action of wheels of carriages. In those
parts of the road, if any, where materials
of good quality could not be obtained for
the road in sufficient quantity to afford a
course of six inches, new stone was procured
to make up the deficiency to that
thickness; but it was considered unnecessary,
in any part, to put on a covering of
more than nine inches. None but limestone,
flint, or granite were used for the
covering, if practicable; and no covering
was placed upon the bed of the road till it
had become well compacted and thoroughly
dried. At proper intervals, on the slopes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of hills, drains or paved catch-waters were
made across the road, whenever the cost of
constructing culverts rendered their use
inexpedient. These catch-waters were
made with a gradual curvature, so as to
give no jolts to the wheels of carriages
passing over them; but whenever the
expense justified the introduction of culverts,
they were used in preference, and in
all cases where the water crossed the road,
either in catch-waters or through culverts,
sufficient pavements and overfalls were
constructed to provide against the possibility
of the road or banks being washed
away by it.</p>

<p>The masonry of the bridges, culverts, and
side-walls was ordered to be repaired,
whenever required, in a substantial manner,
and care was taken that the mortar
used was of good quality, without admixture
of raw clay. All the masonry was
well pointed with hydraulic mortar, and in
no case was the pointing allowed to be put
on after the middle of October. All masonry
finished after this time was well
covered, and pointed early in the spring.
Care was taken, also, to provide means for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
carrying off the water from the bases of
walls, to prevent the action of frost on
their foundations; and it was considered
highly important that all foundations in
masonry should be well pointed with
hydraulic mortar to a depth of eighteen
inches below the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>By the year 1818, travel over the first
great road across the Allegheny Mountains
into the Ohio Basin had begun.</p>

<h3>BUILDING THE ROAD IN THE WEST</h3>


<p>The tales of those who knew the road
in the West and those who knew it
in the East are much alike. It is
probable that there was one important distinction&mdash;the
passenger traffic of the road
between the Potomac and Ohio, which gave
life on that portion of the road a peculiar
flavor, was doubtless not equaled on the
western division.</p>

<p>For many years the center of western
population was in the Ohio Valley, and
good steamers were plying the Ohio when
the Cumberland Road was first opened.
Indeed the road was originally intended
for the accommodation of the lower Ohio
Valley.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Still, as the century grew old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and the interior population became considerable,
the Ohio division of the road
became a crowded thoroughfare. An old
stage-driver in eastern Ohio remembers
when business was such that he and his
companion Knights of Rein and Whip
never went to bed for twenty nights, and
more than a hundred teams might have
been met in a score of miles.</p>

<p>When the road was built to Wheeling, its
greatest mission was accomplished&mdash;the
portage path across the mountains was
completed to a point where river navigation
was almost always available. And
yet less than half of the road was finished.
It now touched the eastern extremity of
the great state whose public lands were
being sold in order to pay for its building.
Westward lay the growing states of Indiana
and Illinois, a per cent of the sale of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
whose land had already been pledged to the
road. Then came another moment when
the great work paused and the original
ambition of its friends was at hazard.</p>

<p>In 1820 Congress appropriated one hundred
and forty-one thousand dollars for
completing the road from Washington,
Pennsylvania to Wheeling. In the same
year ten thousand dollars was appropriated
for laying out the road between Wheeling,
Virginia and a point on the left bank of
the Mississippi River, between St. Louis
and the mouth of the Illinois River. For
four years the fate of the road west of the
Ohio hung in the balance, during which
time the road was menaced by the specter
of unconstitutionality, already mentioned.
But on the third day of March, 1825, a bill
was passed by Congress appropriating one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars for
building the road to Zanesville, Ohio, and
the extension of the surveys to the permanent
seat of government in Missouri, to
pass by the seats of government of Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Two years later,
one hundred and seventy thousand dollars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
was appropriated to complete the road to
Zanesville, Ohio, and in 1829 an additional
appropriation for continuing it westward
was made.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It has been noted that the Cumberland
Road from Cumberland to Wheeling was
built on a general alignment of a former
thoroughfare of the red men and the
pioneers. So with much of the course west
of the Ohio. Between Wheeling and
Zanesville the Cumberland Road followed
the course of the first road made through
Ohio, that celebrated route marked out, by
way of Lancaster and Chillicothe, to Kentucky,
by Colonel Ebenezer Zane, and
which bore the name of Zane&rsquo;s Trace.
This first road built in Ohio was authorized
by an act of Congress passed May 17, 1796.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
This route through Ohio was a well worn
road a quarter of a century before the
Cumberland Road was extended across the
Ohio River.</p>

<p>The act of 1825, authorizing the extension
of the great road into the state of
Ohio, was greeted with intense enthusiasm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
by the people of the West. The fear that
the road would not be continued beyond
the Ohio River was generally entertained,
and for good reasons. The debate of constitutionality,
which had been going on for
several years, increased the fear. And yet
it would have been breaking faith with the
West by the national Government to have
failed to continue the road.</p>

<p>The act appropriated one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars for an extension of
the road from Wheeling to Zanesville,
Ohio, and work was immediately undertaken.
The Ohio was by far the greatest
body of water which the road crossed, and
for many years the passage from Wheeling
to the opposite side of the Ohio, Bridgeport,
was made by ferry. Later a great
bridge, the admiration of the countryside,
was erected. The road entered Ohio in
Belmont County, and eventually crossed
the state in a due line west, not deviating
its course even to touch cities of such importance
as Newark or Dayton, although,
in the case of the former at least, such a
course would have been less expensive than
the one pursued. Passing due west the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
road was built through Belmont, Guernsey,
Muskingum, Licking, Franklin, Madison,
Clark, Montgomery, and Preble Counties,
a distance of over three hundred miles. A
larger portion of the Cumberland Road
which was actually completed lay in Ohio
than in all other states through which it
passed combined.</p>

<p>The work on the road between Wheeling
and Zanesville was begun in 1825-26.
Ground was broken with great ceremony
opposite the Court House at St. Clairsville,
Belmont County, July 4, 1825. An address
was made by Mr. William B. Hubbard.
The cost of the road in eastern Ohio was
much less than the cost in Pennsylvania,
averaging only about three thousand four
hundred dollars per mile. This included
three-inch layers of broken stone, masonry
bridges, and culverts. Large appropriations
were made for the road in succeeding
years and the work went on from Zanesville
due west to Columbus. The course of the
road between Zanesville and Columbus was
perhaps the first instance where the road
ignored, entirely, the general alignment of
a previous road between the same two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
points. The old road between Zanesville
and Columbus went by way of Newark and
Granville, a roundabout course, but probably
the most practicable, as anyone may
attest who has traveled over the Cumberland
Road in the western part of Muskingum
County. A long and determined
effort was made by citizens of Newark and
Granville to have the new road follow the
course of the old, but without effect. Ohio
had not, like Pennsylvania, demanded that
the road should pass through certain towns.
The only direction named by law was that
the road should go west on the straightest
possible line through the capital of each

<p>The course between Zanesville and
Columbus was located by the United States
commissioner, Jonathan Knight, Esq., who,
accompanied by his associates (one of whom
was the youthful Joseph E. Johnson),
arrived in Columbus, October 5, 1825.
Bids for contracts for building the road
from Zanesville to Columbus were advertised
to be received at the superintendent&rsquo;s
office at Zanesville, from the twenty-third
to the thirtieth of June, 1829. The road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was fully completed by 1833. The road
entered Columbus on Friend (now Main)
Street. There was great rivalry between
the North End and South End over the
road&rsquo;s entrance into the city. The matter
was compromised by having it enter on
Friend Street and take its exit on West
Broad, traversing High to make the connection.</p>

<p>Concerning the route out of Columbus,
the <i>Ohio State Journal</i> said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The adopted route leaves Columbus at
Broad Street, crosses the Scioto River at
the end of that street and on the new
wooden bridge erected in 1826 by an individual
having a charter from the state.
The bridge is not so permanent nor so
spacious as could be desired, yet it may
answer the intended purposes for several
years to come. Thence the location passes
through the village of Franklinton, and
across the low grounds to the bluff which
is surrounded at a depression formed by a
ravine, and at a point nearly in the prolongation
in the direction of Broad Street;
thence by a small angle, a straight line to
the bluffs of Darby Creek; to pass the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
creek and its bluffs some angles were
necessary; thence nearly a straight line
through Deer Creek Barrens, and across
that stream to the dividing grounds,
between the Scioto and the Miami waters;
thence nearly down to the valley of Beaver
Creek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The preliminary survey westward was
completed in 1826 and extended to Indianapolis,
Indiana. Bids were advertised for
the contract west of Columbus in July 1830.
During the next seven years the work was
pushed on through Madison, Clark, Montgomery,
and Preble Counties and across
the Indiana line. Proposals for bids for
building the road west of Springfield, Ohio,
were advertised for, during August 1837;
a condition being that the first eight miles
be finished by January 1838. These proposals
are interesting today. The following
is a typical advertisement:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">National Road in Ohio.</span>&mdash;Notice to

west of Columbus&mdash;the work to be
completed on or before the 1st day of
January, 1838.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trees and growth to be entirely

<p>Indianapolis was the center of Cumberland
Road operations in Indiana, and from
that city the road was built both eastward
and westward. The road entered Indiana
through Wayne County but was not completed
until taken under a charter from the
state by the Wayne County Turnpike Company,
and finished in 1850. When Indiana
and Illinois received the road from the
national Government it was not completed,
though graded and bridged as far west as
Vandalia, then the capital of Illinois.</p>

<p>The Cumberland Road was not to Indiana
and Illinois what it was to Ohio, for somewhat
similar reasons that it was less to
Ohio than to Pennsylvania, for the further
west it was built the older the century<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
grew, and the newer the means of transportation
which were coming rapidly to the
front. This was true, even, from the very
beginning. The road was hardly a decade
old in Pennsylvania, when two canals and
a railroad over the portage, offered a rival
means of transportation across the state
from Harrisburg to Pittsburg.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> When the
road reached Wheeling, Ohio River travel
was very much improved, and a large
proportion of traffic went down the river
by packet. When the road entered Indiana,
new plans for internal improvements
were under way beside which a turnpike
was almost a relic. In 1835-36, Indiana
passed an internal improvement bill, authorizing
three great canals and a railway.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The proposed railway, from the village of
Madison on the Ohio River northward to
Indianapolis, is a pregnant suggestion of
the amount of traffic to Indiana from the
east which passed down the Ohio from
Wheeling, instead of going overland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
through Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This was, undoubtedly,
mostly passenger traffic, which was very
heavy at this time.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>But the dawning of a new era in transportation
had already been heralded in the
national hall of legislation. In 1832 the
House Committee on Roads and Canals
had discussed in their report the question
of the relative cost of various means of
intercommunication, including railways.
Each report of the committee for the next
five years mentioned the same subject,
until, in 1836, the matter of substituting a
railway for the Cumberland Road between
Columbus and the Mississippi was very
seriously considered.</p>

<p>In that year a House Bill (No. 64) came
back from the Senate amended in two particulars,
one authorizing that the appropriations
made for Illinois should be confined
to grading and bridging only, and should
not be construed as implying that Congress
had pledged itself to macadamize the road.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The House Committee struck out these
amendments and substituted a more sweeping
one than any yet suggested in the
history of the road. This amendment provided
that a railroad be constructed west of
Columbus with the money appropriated for
a highway. The committee reported, that,
after long study of the question, many
reasons appeared why the change should
be made. It was stated to the committee
by respectable authority, that much of the
stone for the masonry and covering for the
road east of Columbus had to be transported
for considerable distances over bad roads
across the adjacent country at very great
expense, and that, in its continuance westward
through Ohio, this source of expense
would be greatly augmented. Nevertheless
the compact at the time of the admission of
the western states supposed the western
termination of the road should be the Mississippi.
The estimated expense of the
road&rsquo;s extension to Vandalia, Illinois,
sixty-five miles east of the Mississippi,
amounted to $4,732,622.83, making the
total expense of the entire road amount to
about ten millions. The committee said it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
would have been unfaithful to the trust
reposed in it, if it had not bestowed much
attention upon this matter, and it did not
hesitate to ground on a recent report of the
Secretary of War, this very important
change of the plan of the road. This
report of the War Department showed that
the distance between Columbus and Vandalia
was three hundred and thirty-four
miles and the estimated cost of completing
the road that far would be $4,732,622.83,
of which $1,120,320.01 had been expended
and $3,547,894.83 remained to be expended
in order to finish the road to that extent
according to plans then in operation; that
after its completion it would require an
annual expenditure on the three hundred
and thirty-four miles of $392,809.71 to keep
it in repair, the engineers computing the
annual cost of repairs of the portion of the
road between Wheeling and Columbus
(one hundred and twenty-seven miles) at
$99,430.30.</p>

<p>On the other hand the estimated cost of
a railway from Columbus to Vandalia on
the route of the Cumberland Road was
$4,280,540.37, and the cost of preservation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and repair of such a road, $173,718.25.
Thus the computed cost of the railway
exceeded that of the turnpike but about
twenty per cent, while the annual expense
of repairing the former would fall short
more than fifty-six per cent. In addition
to the advantage of reduced cost was that
of less time consumed in transportation; for,
assuming as the committee did a rate of
speed of fifteen miles per hour (which was
five miles per hour less than the then
customary speed of railway traveling in
England on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railroad, and about the ordinary rate of
speed of the American locomotives), it
would require only twenty-three hours for
news from Baltimore to reach Columbus,
forty-two hours to Indianapolis, fifty-four
to Vandalia, and fifty-eight to St. Louis.</p>

<p>One interesting argument for the substitution
of the railway for the Cumberland
Road was given as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the relation of the general Government
to the states which it unites is
justly regarded; when it is considered it is
especially charged with the common
defense; that for the attainment of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
end the militia must be combined in time
of war with the regular army and the state
with the United States troops; that mutual
prompt and vigorous concert should mark
the efforts of both for the accomplishment
of a common end and the safety of all; it
seems needless to dwell upon the importance
of transmitting intelligence between
the state and federal government with the
least possible delay and concentrating in a
period of common danger their joint efforts
with the greatest possible dispatch. It is
alike needless to detail the comparative
advantages of a railroad and an ordinary
turnpike under such circumstances. A few
weeks, nay, a very few days, or hours, may
determine the issue of a campaign, though
happily for the United States their distance
from a powerful enemy may limit the contingency
of war to destruction short of that
by which the events of an hour had involved
ruin of an empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the weight of argument presented
by the House Committee their amendment
was in turn stricken out, and the bill of
1836 appropriated six hundred thousand
dollars for the Cumberland Road, both of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the Senate amendments which the House
Committee had stricken out being incorporated
in the bill.</p>

<p>The last appropriation for the Cumberland
Road was dated May 25, 1838; it
granted one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
for the road in both Ohio and Indiana,
and nine thousand dollars for the road in
Illinois.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>OPERATION AND CONTROL</h3>


<p>The Cumberland Road was built by
the United States Government under
the supervision of the War Department.
Of its builders, whose names will
ever live in the annals of the Middle West,
Brigadier-general Gratiot, Captains Delafield,
McKee, Bliss, Bartlett Hartzell,
Williams, Colquit, and Cass, and Lieutenants
Mansfield, Vance, and Pickell are best
remembered on the eastern division.
Nearly all became heroes of the Mexican
or Civil Wars, McKee falling at Buena
Vista, Williams at Monterey, and Mansfield,
then major-general, at Antietam.</p>

<p>Among the best known supervisors in the
west were Commissioners C. W. Weaver,
G. Dutton, and Jonathan Knight.</p>

<p>The road had been built across the Ohio
River but a short time when it was realized
that a revenue must be raised for its sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>port
from those who traveled upon it. As
we have seen, a law was passed in both
houses of Congress, in 1824, authorizing
the Government to erect tollgates and
charge toll on the Cumberland Road as the
states should surrender this right.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> This
bill was vetoed by President Monroe, on
grounds already stated, and the road fell
into a very bad condition. But what the
national Government could not do the
individual states could do, and, consequently,
as fast as repairs were completed,
the Government surrendered the road to
the states through which it passed. Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia,
accepted completed portions of the road
between 1831 and 1834.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The legislatures
of Ohio and Pennsylvania at once passed
laws concerning the erection of tollgates,
Ohio authorizing one gate every twenty
miles, February 4, 1831,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and Pennsylvania
authorizing the erection of six tollgates by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
an act passed April 11, of the same year.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The gates in Pennsylvania were located
as follows: Gate No. 1 at the east end of
Petersburg, No. 2 near Mt. Washington,
No. 3 near Searights, No. 4 near Beallsville,
No. 5 near Washington, and No. 6
near West Alexander.</p>

<p>The Cumberland Road was under the
control of commissioners appointed by the
President of the United States, the state
legislatures, or governors.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Upon these
commissioners lay the task of repairing the
road, which included the making of contracts,
reviewing the work done, and
rendering payment for the same. None of
the work of building the road fell on the
state officials. Therefore, in Ohio, two
great departments were simultaneously in
operation, the building of the road by the
government officials, and the work of
operating and repairing the road, under
state officials. Two commissioners were
appointed in Pennsylvania, in 1847, one
acting east, and the other west, of the
Monongahela River.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In 1836 Ohio placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
all her works of internal improvement
under the supervision of a Board of Public
Works, into whose hands the Cumberland
Road passed.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Special commissioners were
appointed from time to time by the state
legislatures to perform special duties, such
as overseeing work being done, auditing
accounts, or settling disputes.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Two resident
engineers were appointed over the
eastern and western divisions of the road
in Ohio, thus doing away with the continual
employment and dismissal of the most
important of all officials. These engineers
made quarterly reports concerning the
road&rsquo;s condition.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The road was conveniently divided by
the several states into departments. East
of the Ohio River, the Monongahela River
was a division line, the road being divided
by it into two divisions.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> West of the
Ohio the eighty-seventh mile post from
Wheeling was, at one time, a division line
between two departments in Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Later,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the road in Ohio was cut up into as many
divisions as counties through which it
passed.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The work of repairing was let
by contract, for which bids had been previously
advertised. Contracts were usually
let in one-mile sections, sometimes for a
longer space, notice of the length being
given in the advertisement for bids. Contractors
were compelled to give testimonials
of good character and reliability; though
one contract, previously quoted, professed
to be satisfied with &ldquo;competent or responsible
individuals only.&rdquo; A time limit was
usually named in the contract, with penalties
for failure to complete the work in
time assigned.</p>

<p>The building of the road was hailed with
delight by hundreds of contractors and thousands
of laborers, who now had employment
offered them worthy of their best labor,
and the work, when well done, stood as a
lasting monument to their skill. Old
papers and letters speak frequently of the
enthusiasm awakened among the laboring
classes by the building of the great road,
and of the lively scenes witnessed in those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
busy years. Contractors who early earned
a reputation followed the road westward,
taking up contract after contract as opportunity
offered. Farmers who lived on the
route of the road engaged in the work
when not busy in their fields, and for their
labor and the use of the teams received good
pay. Thus not only in its heyday did the
road prove a benefit to the country through
which it passed, but at the very beginning
it became such, and not a little of the
money spent upon it by the Government
went into the very pockets from which it
came by the sale of land.</p>

<p>The great pride taken by the states in
the Cumberland Road is brought out significantly
in the laws passed concerning it.
Pennsylvania and Ohio legislatures passed
laws as early as 1828, and within three days
of each other (Pennsylvania, April 7,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and
Ohio, April 11<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>), looking toward the permanent
repair and preservation of the road.
There were penalties for breaking or defacing
the milestones, culverts, parapet walls,
and bridges. A person found guilty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
such act of vandalism was &ldquo;fined in a sum
of not more than five hundred dollars, or
be imprisoned in a dungeon of the jail of
the county, and be fed on bread and water
only, not exceeding thirty days, or both, at
the discretion of the court.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> There were
penalties for allowing the drains to become
obstructed, for premature traveling on
unfinished portions of the roadbed;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
permitting a wagon to stand over night on
the roadbed, and for locking wheels, except
where ice made this necessary. Local
authorities were ordered to build suitable
culverts wherever the roads connected with
the Cumberland Road. &ldquo;Directors&rdquo; were
ordered to be set up, to warn drivers to turn
to the left when passing other teams.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
The rates of toll were ordered to be posted
where the public could see them.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> &ldquo;Beacons&rdquo;
were erected along the margin of
the roadbed to keep teams from turning
aside. Laws were passed forbidding the
removal of these.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The operation of the Cumberland Road
included the establishment of the toll
system, which provided the revenue for
keeping it in repair; and from the tolls the
most vital statistics concerning the old road
are to be obtained. Immediately upon the
passing of the road into the control of the
individual states, tollgates were authorized,
as previously noted. Schedules of tariff
were published by the various states. The
schedule of 1831 in Pennsylvania was as
follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The tolls established the same year in
Ohio (see table, pp. 103-104) were higher
than those charged in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the toll system is
patent. Rates of toll were determined by
the wear on the road. Tolls were charged
in order to keep the road in repair, and,
consequently, each animal or vehicle was
taxed in proportion as it damaged the roadbed.
Cattle were taxed twice as heavily
as sheep or hogs, and, according to the
tariff of 1845, hogs were taxed twice as
much as sheep. The tariff on vehicles was
determined by the width of the tires used,
for the narrower the tire the more the roadbed
was cut up. Wide tires were encouraged,
those over six inches (later eight)

<p>Estimates differed in various states but
averaged up quite evenly. To the rising
generation, to whom tollgates are almost
unknown, a study of the toll system affords
novel entertainment, helping one to realize
something of one of the most serious questions
of public economics of two generations
ago. Tollgates averaged one in eighteen
or twenty miles in Pennsylvania, and one
in ten miles in Ohio, with tolls a little
higher than half the rate in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Tollgate-keepers were appointed by the
governor in the early days in Ohio,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but,
later, by the commissioners. These keepers
received a salary which was deducted
from their collections, the remainder being
turned over to the commissioners. The
salary established in Ohio in 1832 was one
hundred and eighty dollars per annum.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
In 1836 it was increased to two hundred
dollars per annum, and tollgate-keepers
were also allowed to retain five per cent of
all tolls received above one thousand dollars.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
In 1845 tollgate-keepers were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
ordered to make returns on the first Monday
in each month, and the allowance of
their per cent on receipts over one thousand
dollars was cut off, leaving their salary at
two hundred dollars per annum.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Equally
perplexing with the question of just tolls
was found to be the question of determining
what and who should have free use of
the Cumberland Road. This list was
increased at various times, and, in most
states, included the following at one time
or another: persons going to, or returning
from public worship, muster, common place
of business on farm or woodland, funeral,
mill, place of election, common place of
trading or marketing within the county in
which they resided. This included persons,
wagons, carriages, and horses or
oxen drawing the same. No toll was
charged school children or clergymen, or
for passage of stage and horses carrying
United States Mail, or any wagon or carriage
laden with United States property, or
cavalry, troops, arms, or military stores of
the United States, or any single state, or
for persons on duty in the military service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of the United States, or for the militia of
any single state. In Pennsylvania, a certain
stage line made the attempt to carry
passengers by the tollgates free, taking
advantage of the clauses allowing free
passage of the United States mail by putting
a mail sack on each passenger coach.
The stage was halted and the matter taken
into court, where the case was decided
against the stage company, and persons
traveling with mailcoaches were compelled
to pay toll.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Ohio took advantage of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s
experience and passed a law that
passengers on stagecoaches be obliged to
pay toll.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Pennsylvania exempted persons
hauling coal for home consumption from
paying toll.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Many varied and curious
attempts to evade payment of tolls were
made, and laws were passed inflicting heavy
fine upon all convicted of such malefaction.
In Ohio, tollgate-keepers were empowered
to arrest those suspected of such attempts,
and, upon conviction, the fine went into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
road fund of the county wherein the offense
occurred.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Persons making long trips on the road
could pay toll for the entire distance and receive
a certificate guaranteeing free passage
to their destination.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Compounding rates
were early put in force, applying, in Ohio,
for persons residing within eight miles of
the road,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the radius being extended later
to ten.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Passengers in the stages were
counted by the tollgate-keepers and the
company operating the stage charged with
the toll. At the end of each month, stage
companies settled with the authorities.
Thus it became possible for the stage drivers
to deceive the gate-keepers, and save
their companies large sums of money.
Drivers were compelled to declare the
number of passengers in their stage, and
in the event of failing to do so, gate-keepers
were allowed to charge the company
for as many passengers as the stage could
contain.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Stage lines were permitted to compound
for yearly passage of stages over the road
and the large companies took advantage of
the provision, though the passengers were
counted by the gate-keepers. It may be
seen that gate-keepers were in a position
to embezzle large sums of money if they
were so minded, and it is undoubted that
this was done in more than one instance.
Indeed, with a score and a half of gates,
and a great many traveling on special rates,
it would have been remarkable if some
employed in all those years during which
the toll system was in general operation
did not steal. But this is lifting the veil
from the good old days!</p>

<p>As will be seen later, the amounts
handled by the gate-keepers were no small
sums. In the best days of the road the
average amount handled by tollgate-keepers
in Pennsylvania was about eighteen
hundred dollars per annum. In Ohio, with
gates every ten miles, the average (reported)
collection was about two thousand dollars
in the best years. It is difficult to reconcile
the statement made by Mr. Searight
concerning the comparative amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
business done on various portions of the
Cumberland Road, with the figures he
himself quotes. He says: &ldquo;It is estimated
that two-fifths of the trade and travel of
the road were diverted at Brownsville, and
fell into the channel furnished at that point
by the slackwater navigation of the Monongahela
River, and a similar proportion
descended the Ohio from Wheeling, and the
remaining fifth continued on the road to
Columbus, Ohio, and points further west.
The travel west of Wheeling was chiefly
local, and the road presented scarcely a
tithe of the thrift, push, whirl and excitement
which characterized it east of that
point.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> On another page Mr. Searight
gives the account of the old-time superintendents
of the road in Pennsylvania in its
most prosperous era, one dating from
November 10, 1840 to November 10, 1841,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
the other from May 1, 1843 to December
31, 1844.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> In the first of these periods the
amount of tolls received from the eastern
division of the road (east of the Monongahela)
is two thousand dollars less than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
amount received from the western division.
Even after the amounts paid by the two
great stage companies are deducted, a balance
of over a thousand dollars is left in
favor of the division west of the Monongahela
River. In the second report, $4,242.37
more was received on the western division
of the road than on the eastern, and even
after the amounts received from the stage
companies are deducted, the receipts from
the eastern division barely exceed those of
the western. How can it be that &ldquo;two-fifths
of the trade and travel of the road
were diverted at Brownsville?&rdquo; And the
further west Mr. Searight goes, the more
does he seem to err, for the road west of
the Ohio River, instead of showing
&ldquo;scarcely a tithe of the thrift, push, whirl
and excitement which characterized it east
of that point,&rdquo; seems to have done a
greater business than the eastern portion.
For instance, when the road was completed
as many miles in Ohio as were built in
Pennsylvania, the return from the portion
in Ohio (1833) was $12,259.42-4 (in the very
first year that the road was completed),
while in Pennsylvania the receipts in 1840<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
were only $18,429.25, after the road had
been used for twenty-two years. In the
same year (1840) Ohio collected $51,364.67
from her Cumberland Road tollgates&mdash;about
three times the amount collected in
Pennsylvania. Again Mr. Searight gives
a Pennsylvania commissioner&rsquo;s receipts for
the twenty months beginning May 1, 1843,
as $37,109.11, while the receipts from the
road in Ohio in only the twelve months of
1843 were $32,157.02. At the same time
the tolls charged in Ohio were a trifle in
excess of those imposed in Pennsylvania,
therefore, Ohio&rsquo;s advantage must be curtailed
slightly. On the other hand it
should be taken into consideration that the
Cumberland Road in Pennsylvania was
almost the only road across the portion of
the state through which it ran, while in Ohio
other roads were used, especially clay roads
running parallel with the Cumberland Road,
by drivers of sheep and pigs, as an aged
informant testifies. As Mr. Searight has
said, the travel of the road west of the Ohio
may have been chiefly of a local nature, yet
his seeming error concerning the relative
amount of travel on the two divisions in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
own state, makes his statements less trustworthy
in the matter. Still it can be readily
believed that a great deal of continental
trade did pass down the Monongahela after
traversing the eastern division of the road
and that increased local trade on the western
division rendered the toll receipts of
the two divisions quite equal. Local travel
on the eastern division may have been
light, comparatively speaking. Mr. Searight
undoubtedly meant that two-fifths of
the through trade stopped at Brownsville
and Wheeling and one-fifth only went on
into Ohio. The total amount of tolls
received by Pennsylvania from all roads,
canals, etc., in 1836 was about $50,000,
while Ohio received a greater sum than
that in 1838 from tolls on the Cumberland
Road alone, and the road was not completed
further west than Springfield.</p>

<p>A study of the amounts of tolls taken in
from the Cumberland Road by the various
states will show at once the volume of the
business done. Ohio received from the
Cumberland Road in forty-seven years
nearly a million and a quarter dollars. An
itemized list of this great revenue shows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the varying fortunes of the great road:</p>

<p>About 1850 Ohio began leasing portions
of the Cumberland Road to private companies.
In 1854 the entire distance from
Springfield to the Ohio River was leased
for a term of ten years for $6,105 a year.
Commissioners were appointed to view the
road continually and make the lessees keep
it in as good condition as when it came into
their hands.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Before the contract had half
expired, the Board of Public Works was
ordered (April, 1859) to take the road to
relieve the lessees.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In 1870 the proper
limits of the road were designated to be
&ldquo;a space of eighty feet in width, and where
the road passed over a street in any city of
the second class, the width should conform
to the width of that street,&rdquo; such cities to
own it so long as it was kept in repair.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Finally, in 1876, the state of Ohio authorized
commissioners of the several counties
to take so much of the road as lay in each
county under their control. It was stipulated
that tollgates should not average
more than one in ten miles, and that no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
toll be collected between Columbus and
the Ohio Central Lunatic Asylum. The
county commissioners were to complete
any unfinished portions of the road.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Later (1877) the rates of toll were left to
the discretion of the county commissioners,
with this provision:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That when the consent of the Congress
of the United States shall have been obtained
thereto, the county commissioners
of any county having a population under
the last Federal census of more than fifteen
thousand six hundred and less than fifteen
thousand six hundred and fifty shall have
the power when they deem it for the best
interest of the road, or when the people
whom the road accommodates wish, to submit
to the legal voters of the county, at
any regular or special election, the question,
&lsquo;Shall the National Road be a free
turnpike road?&rsquo; And when the question is
so submitted, and a majority of all those
voting on said question shall vote yes, it
shall be the duty of said commissioners to
sell gates, tollhouses and any other property
belonging to the road to the highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
bidder, the proceeds of the sale to be
applied to the repair of the road, and
declare so much of the road as lies within
their county a free turnpike road to be

<p>It will be noted that April was the heaviest
month of the year. The gate-keeper re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ceived
a salary of thirty dollars per month.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that this
great American highway was never a self-supporting
institution. The fact that it was
estimated that the yearly expense of repairing
the Ohio division of the road was one
hundred thousand dollars, while the greatest
amount of tolls collected in its most
prosperous year (1839) was a little more
than half that amount ($62,496.10) proves
this conclusively. Investigation into the
records of other states shows the same condition.
In the most prosperous days of the
road, the tolls in Maryland (1837) amounted
to $9,953 and the expenditures $9,660.51.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
In 1839 a &ldquo;balance&rdquo; was recorded of
$1,509.08, but a like amount was charged
up on the debtor side of the account. The
receipts reported each year in the auditor&rsquo;s
reports of the state of Ohio show that equal
amounts were expended yearly upon the
road. As early as 1832 the governor of
Ohio was authorized to borrow money to
repair the road in that state.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>STAGECOACHES AND FREIGHTERS</h3>


<p>The great work of building and keeping
in repair the Cumberland Road,
and of operating it, developed a race
of men as unknown before its era as afterward.
For the real life of the road, however,
one will look to the days of its
prime&mdash;to those who passed over its stately
stretches and dusty coils as stage- and
mail-coach drivers, express carriers and
&ldquo;wagoners,&rdquo; and the tens of thousands of
passengers and immigrants who composed
the public which patronized the great highway.
This was the real life of the road&mdash;coaches
numbering as many as twenty
traveling in a single line; wagonhouse
yards where a hundred tired horses rested
over night beside their great loads; hotels
where seventy transient guests have been
served breakfast in a single morning; a
life made cheery by the echoing horns of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
hurrying stages; blinded by the dust of
droves of cattle numbering into the thousands;
a life noisy with the satisfactory
creak and crunch of the wheels of great
wagons carrying six and eight thousand
pounds of freight east or west.</p>

<p>The revolution of society since those
days could not have been more surprising.
The change has been so great it is a wonder
that men deign to count their gain by
the same numerical system. As Macaulay
has said, we do not travel today, we merely
&ldquo;arrive.&rdquo; You are hardly a traveler now
unless you cross a continent. Travel was
once an education. This is growing less
and less true with the passing years.
Fancy a journey from St. Louis to New
York in the old coaching days, over the
Cumberland and the old York Roads. How
many persons the traveler met! How
many interesting and instructive conversations
were held with fellow travelers
through the long hours; what customs,
characters, foibles, amusing incidents
would be noticed and remembered, ever
afterward furnishing the information necessary
to help one talk well and the sympathy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
necessary to render one capable of listening
to others. The traveler often sat at table
with statesmen whom the nation honored,
as well as with stagecoach-drivers whom a
nation knew for their skill and prowess
with six galloping horses. Henry Clays
and &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Buntings dined together, and
each made the other wiser, if not better.
The greater the gulf grows between the
rich and poor, the more ignorant do both
become, particularly the rich. There was
undoubtedly a monotony in stagecoach
journeying, but the continual views of the
landscape, the ever-fresh air, the constantly
passing throngs of various description,
made such traveling an experience unknown
to us &ldquo;arrivers&rdquo; of today. How
fast it has been forgotten that travel means
seeing people rather than things. The age
of sight-seeing has superseded that of traveling.
How few of us can say with the
New Hampshire sage: &ldquo;We have traveled
a great deal &lsquo;in Concord.&rsquo;&rdquo; Splendidly
are the old coaching days described by
Thackeray, who caught their spirit:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Island rang, as yet, with the tooting
horns and rattling teams of mail-coaches;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a gay sight was the road in merry England
in those days, before steam-engines arose
and flung its hostelry and chivalry over.
To travel in coaches, to drive coaches, to
know coachmen and guards, to be familiar
with inns along the road, to laugh with the
jolly hostess in the bar, to chuck the pretty
chambermaid under the chin, were the
delight of men who were young not very
long ago. The Road was an institution,
the Ring was an institution. Men rallied
around them; and, not without a kind conservatism,
expatiated upon the benefits
with which they endowed the country, and
the evils which would occur when they
should be no more:&mdash;decay of English
spirit, decay of manly pluck, ruin of the
breed of horses, and so forth, and so forth.
To give and take a black eye was not unusual
nor derogatory in a gentleman; to
drive a stage-coach the enjoyment, the
emulation of generous youth. Is there any
young fellow of the present time who
aspires to take the place of a stoker? You
see occasionally in Hyde Park one dismal
old drag with a lonely driver. Where are
you, charioteers? Where are you, O rat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>tling
&lsquo;Quicksilver,&rsquo; O swift &lsquo;Defiance?&rsquo;
You are passed by racers stronger and
swifter than you. Your lamps are out,
and the music of your horns has died
away.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In the old coaching days the passenger- and
mail-coaches were operated very much
like the railways of today. A vast network
of lines covered the land. Great companies
owned hundreds of stages operating on
innumerable routes, competing with other
companies. These rival stage companies
fought each other at times with great
bitterness, and competed, as railways do
today, in lowering tariff and in outdoing
each other in points of speed and accommodation.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
New inventions and appliances
were eagerly sought in the hope of securing
a larger share of public patronage. This
competition extended into every phase of
the business&mdash;fast horses, comfortable
coaches, well-known and companionable
drivers, favorable connections.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>However, competition, as is always the
case, sifted the competitors down to a small
number. Companies which operated upon
the Cumberland Road between Indianapolis
and Cumberland became distinct in character
and catered to a steady patronage
which had its distinctive characteristics and
social tone. This was in part determined
by the taverns which the various lines
patronized. Each line ordinarily stopped
at separate taverns in every town. There
were also found Grand Union taverns on the
Cumberland Road. Had this system of
communication not been abandoned, coach
lines would have gone through the same
experience that the railways have, and for
very similar reasons.</p>

<p>The largest coach line on the Cumberland
Road was the National Road Stage
Company, whose most prominent member
was Lucius W. Stockton. The headquarters
of this line were at the National House
on Morgantown Street, Uniontown, Pennsylvania.
The principal rival of the
National Road Stage Company was the
&ldquo;Good Intent&rdquo; line, owned by Shriver,
Steele, and Company, with headquarters at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the McClelland House, Uniontown. The
Ohio National Stage Company, with headquarters
at Columbus, Ohio, operated on
the western division of the road. There
were many smaller lines, as the &ldquo;Landlords,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pilot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pioneer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Defiance,&rdquo;
&ldquo;June Bug,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>Some of the first lines of stages were
operated in sections, each section having
different proprietors who could sell out at
any time. The greater lines were constantly
absorbing smaller lines and extending
their ramifications in all directions. It
will be seen there were trusts even in the
&ldquo;good old days&rdquo; of stagecoaches, when
smaller firms were &ldquo;gobbled up&rdquo; and
&ldquo;driven out&rdquo; as happens today, and will
ever happen in mundane history, despite
the nonsense of political garblers. One of
the largest stage companies on the old road
was Neil, Moore, and Company of Columbus,
which operated hundreds of stages
throughout Ohio. It was unable to compete
with the Ohio National Stage Company
to which it finally sold out, Mr. Neil
becoming one of the magnates of the latter
company, which was, compared with cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>porations
of its time, a greater trust than
anything known in Ohio today.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>To know what the old coaches really
were, one should see and ride in one. It
is doubtful if a single one now remains
intact. Here and there inquiry will raise
the rumor of an old coach still standing on
wheels, but if the rumor is traced to its
source, it will be found that the chariot
was sold to a circus or wild west show or
has been utterly destroyed. The demand
for the old stages has been quite lively on
the part of the wild west shows. These old
coaches were handsome affairs in their
day&mdash;painted and decorated profusely
without, and lined within with soft silk
plush.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> There were ordinarily three seats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
inside, each capable of holding three passengers.
Upon the driver&rsquo;s high outer
seat was room for one more passenger, a
fortunate position in good weather. The
best coaches, like their counterparts on the
railways of today, were named; the names
of states, warriors, statesmen, generals,
nations, and cities, besides fanciful names, as
&ldquo;Jewess,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ivanhoe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sultana,&rdquo; &ldquo;Loch
Lomond,&rdquo; were called into requisition.</p>

<p>The first coaches to run on the Cumberland
Road were long, awkward affairs,
without braces or springs, and with seats
placed crosswise. The door was in front,
and passengers, on entering, had to climb
over the seats. These first coaches were
made at Little Crossings, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The bodies of succeeding coaches were
placed upon thick, wide leathern straps
which served as springs and which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
called &ldquo;thorough braces.&rdquo; At either end
of the body was the driver&rsquo;s boot and the
baggage boot. The first &ldquo;Troy&rdquo; coach
put on the road came in 1829. It was a
great novelty, but some hundreds of them
were soon throwing the dust of Maryland
and Pennsylvania into the air. Their cost
then was between four and six hundred
dollars. The harness used on the road
was of giant proportions. The backbands
were often fifteen inches wide, and the hip
bands, ten. The traces were chains with
short thick links and very heavy.</p>

<p>But the passenger traffic of the Cumberland
Road bore the same relation to the
freight traffic as passenger traffic does to
freight on the modern railway&mdash;a small
item, financially considered. It was for
the great wagons and their wagoners to
haul over the mountains and distribute
throughout the west the products of mill and
factory and the rich harvests of the fields.
And this great freight traffic created a race
of men of its own, strong and daring, as
they well had need to be. The fact that
teamsters of these &ldquo;mountain ships&rdquo; had
taverns or &ldquo;wagon houses&rdquo; of their own,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
where they stopped, tended to separate
them into a class by themselves. These
wagonhouses were far more numerous than
the taverns along the road, being found as
often as one in every mile or two. Here,
in the commodious yards, the weary horses
and their swarthy Jehus slept in the open
air. In winter weather the men slept on
the floors of the wagonhouses. In summer
many wagoners carried their own cooking
utensils. In the suburbs of the towns
along the road they would pull their teams
out into the roadside and pitch camp, sending
into the village to replenish their stores.</p>

<p>The bed of the old road freighter was
long and deep, bending upward at the bottom
at either end. The lower broad side
was painted blue, with a movable board
inserted above, painted red. The top
covering was white canvas drawn over
broad wooden bows. Many of the wagoners
hung bells of a shape much similar to
dinner bells on a thin iron arch over the
hames of the harness. Often the number
of bells indicated the prowess of a teamster&rsquo;s
horses, as the custom prevailed, in
certain parts, that when a team became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
fast, or was unable to make the grade, the
wagoner rendering the necessary assistance
appropriated all the bells of the luckless
team.</p>

<p>The wheels of the freighters were of a
size proportionate to the rest of the wagon.
The first wagons used on the old roads had
narrow rims, but it was not long before the
broad rims, or &ldquo;broad-tread wagons,&rdquo;
came into general use by those who made
a business of freighting. The narrow rims
were always used by farmers, who, during
the busiest season on the road, deserted
their farms for the high wages temporarily
to be made, and who in consequence were
dubbed &ldquo;sharpshooters&rdquo; by the regulars.
The width of the broad-tread wheels was
four inches. As will be noted, tolls for
broad wheels were less than for the narrow
ones which tended to cut the roadbed more
deeply. One ingenious inventor planned
to build a wheel with a rim wide enough to
pass the tollgates free. The model was a
wagon which had the rear axle four inches
shorter than the front, making a track eight
inches in width. Nine horses were hitched
to this wagon, three abreast. The team<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
caused much comment, but was not voted
practicable.</p>

<p>The loads carried on the mountain ships
were very large. An Ohio man, McBride
by name, in the winter of 1848 went over
the mountains with seven horses, taking a
load of nine hogsheads weighing an average
of one thousand pounds each.</p>

<p>The following description is from the
<i>St. Clairsville</i> (Ohio) <i>Gazette</i> of 1835:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a familiar saying with Sam
Patch that <i>some things can be done easier than
others</i>, and this fact was forcibly brought to
our mind by seeing a six-horse team pass our
office on Wednesday last, laden with <i>eleven
hogsheads of tobacco</i>, destined for Wheeling.
Some speculation having gone forth as to
its weight, the driver was induced to test
it on the hay scales in this place, and it
amounted to 13,280 lbs. gross weight&mdash;net
weight 10,375. This team (owned by General
C. Hoover of this county) took the
load into Wheeling with ease, having a hill
to ascend from the river to the level of the
town, of eight degrees. The Buckeyes of
Belmont may challenge competition in this
line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Teamsters received good wages, especially
when trade was brisk. From Brownsville
to Cumberland they often received
$1.25 a hundred; $2.25 per hundred has
been paid for a load hauled from Wheeling
to Cumberland.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The stage-drivers received
twelve dollars a month with board
and lodging. Usually the stage-drivers
had one particular route between two towns
about twelve miles apart on which they
drove year after year, and learned it as
well as trainmen know their &ldquo;runs&rdquo; today.
The life was hard, but the dash and spirit
rendered it as fascinating as railway life is
now.</p>

<p>Far better time was made by these old
conveyances than many realize. Ten miles
an hour was an ordinary rate of speed. A
stage-driver was dismissed more quickly
for making slow time, than for being guilty
of intoxication, though either offense was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
considered worthy of dismissal. The way-bills
handed to the drivers with the reins
often bore the words: &ldquo;Make this time or
we&rsquo;ll find some one who will.&rdquo; Competition
in the matter of speed was as intense
as it is now in the days of steam. A thousand
legends of these rivalries still linger
in story and tradition. Defeated competitors
were held accountable by their companies
and the loads or condition of their
horses were seldom accepted as excuses.
Couplets were often conjured up containing
some brief story of defeat with a cutting
sting for the vanquished driver:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;If you take a seat in Stockton&rsquo;s line<br />
You are sure to be passed by Pete Burdine.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">or,</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Said Billy Willis to Peter Burdine<br />
You had better wait for the oyster line.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>According to a contemporary account,
in September, 1837, Van Buren&rsquo;s presidential
message was carried from Baltimore
(Canton Depot) to Philadelphia, a distance
of one hundred and forty miles, in four
hours and forty-three minutes. Seventy
miles of the journey was done by rail,
three by boat, and eighty-seven by horse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
The seventy-three by rail and boat occupied
one hundred and seventeen minutes
and the eighty-seven by horse occupied the
remaining two hundred and twenty-six
minutes, or each mile in about two minutes
and a half. This time must be considered
remarkable. The mere fact that these figures
are not at all consistent need occasion
no alarm; they form the most consistent
part of the story.</p>

<p>The news of the death of William the
Fourth of England, which occurred June
20, 1837, was printed in Columbus, Ohio
papers July 28. It was not until 1847 that
the capital of Ohio was connected with the
world by telegraph wires.</p>

<p>Time-tables of passenger coaches were
published as railway time-tables are today.

<p>There was always danger in riding at
night, especially over the mountains,
where sometimes a misstep would cost a
life. The following item from a letter
written in 1837 tells of such an incident:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the Reliance line of stages,
from Frederick to the West, passed through
here on its way to Cumberland. About
ten o&rsquo;clock the ill-fated coach reached a
small spur of the mountain, running to the
Potomac, and between this place and Hancock,
termed Millstone Point, where the
driver mistaking the track, reined his
horses too near the edge of the precipice,
and in the twinkling of an eye, coach,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
horses, driver, and passengers were precipitated
upward of thirty-five feet onto a
bed of rock below&mdash;the coach was dashed
to pieces, and two of the horses killed&mdash;literally
smashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A respectable elderly lady of the name
of Clarke, of Louisville, Kentucky, and a
negro child were crushed to death&mdash;and a
man so dreadfully mangled that his life is
flickering on his lips only. His face was
beaten to a mummy. The other passengers
and the driver were woefully bruised, but
it is supposed they are out of danger.
There were seven in number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot gather that any blame was
attached to the driver. It is said that he
was perfectly sober; but he and his horses
were new to this road, and the night was
foggy and very dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An act of the legislature of Ohio required
that every stagecoach used for the conveyance
of passengers in the night should have
two good lamps affixed in the usual manner,
and subjected the owner to a fine of
from ten to thirty dollars for every forty-eight
hours the coach was not so provided.
Drivers of coaches who should drive in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
night when the track could not be distinctly
seen without having the lamps lighted were
subject to a forfeiture of from five to ten
dollars for each offense. The same act
provided that drivers guilty of intoxication,
so as to endanger the safety of passengers,
on written notice of a passenger on oath,
to the owner or agent, should be forthwith
discharged, and subjected the owner continuing
to employ that driver more than
three days after such notice to a forfeiture
of fifty dollars a day.</p>

<p>Stage proprietors were required to keep
a printed copy of the act posted up in their
offices, under a penalty of five dollars.</p>

<p>Another act of the Ohio legislature subjected
drivers who should leave their horses
without being fastened, to a fine of not over
twenty dollars.</p>

<p>As has been intimated, passengers purchased
their tickets of the stage company
in whose stage they embarked, and the
tolls were included in the price of the
ticket. A paper resembling a waybill was
made out by the agent of the line at the
starting point. This paper was given to
the driver and delivered by him to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
landlord at each station upon the arrival of
the coach. This paper contained the names
and destinations of the passengers carried,
the sums paid as fare and the time of departure,
and contained blank squares for registering
time of arrival and departure from
each station. The fares varied slightly but
averaged about four cents a mile.</p>

<h3>MAILS AND MAIL LINES</h3>


<p>The most important official function
of the Cumberland Road was to furnish
means of transporting the
United States mails. The strongest constitutional
argument of its advocates was
the need of facilities for transporting troops
and mails. The clause in the constitution
authorizing the establishment of post roads
was interpreted by them to include any
measure providing quick and safe transmission
of the mails. As has been seen, it
was finally considered by many to include
building and operating railways with funds
appropriated for the Cumberland Road.</p>

<p>The great mails of seventy-five years ago
were operated on very much the same principle
on which mails are operated today.
The Post Office Department at Washington
contracted with the great stage lines for
the transmission of the mails by yearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
contracts, a given number of stages with a
given number of horses to be run at given
intervals, to stop at certain points, at a fixed
yearly compensation, usually determined
by the custom of advertising for bids and
accepting the lowest offered.</p>

<p>When the system of mailcoach lines
reached its highest perfection, the mails
were handled as they are today. The
great mails that passed over the Cumberland
Road were the Great Eastern and the
Great Western mails out of St. Louis and
Washington. A thousand lesser mail lines
connected with the Cumberland Road at
every step, principally those from Cincinnati
in Ohio, and from Pittsburg in Pennsylvania.
There were through and way
mails, also mails which carried letters only,
newspapers going by separate stage. There
was also an &ldquo;Express Mail&rdquo; corresponding
to the present &ldquo;fast mail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is probably not realized what rapid
time was made by the old-time stage and
express mails over the Cumberland Road
to the Central West. Even compared with
the fast trains of today, the express mails
of sixty years ago, when conditions were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
favorable, made marvelous time. In 1837
the Post Office Department required, in
the contract for carrying the Great Western
Express Mail from Washington over the
Cumberland Road to Columbus and St.
Louis, that the following time be made:</p>

<p>The Post Office Department had given
its mail contracts to the steamship lines in
the east, when possible, from Boston to
Portland and New York to Albany. One
mail route to the southern states, however,
passed over the Cumberland Road and
down to Cincinnati, where it went on to
Louisville and the Mississippi ports by
packet. The following time was made by
this Great Southern Mail from Louisville:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The service rendered to the south and
southwest by the Cumberland Road, was
not rendered to the northwest, as might
have been expected. Chicago and Detroit
were difficult to bring into easy communication
with the east. Until the railway was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
completed from Albany to Buffalo, the
mails went very slowly to the northwest
from New York. The stage line from
Buffalo to Cleveland and on west over the
terrible Black Swamp road to Detroit was
one of the worst in the United States.
When lake navigation became closed, communication
with northwestern Ohio, Michigan,
Wisconsin and northern Indiana and
Illinois was almost cut off. Had the stage
route followed that of the buffalo and
Indian on the high ground occupied by the
Mahoning Indian trail from Pittsburg to
Detroit, a far more excellent service might
have been at the disposal of the Post Office
Department. As it was, stagehorses floundered
in the Black Swamp with &ldquo;mud up
to the horses&rsquo; bridles,&rdquo; where a half dozen
mails were often congested, and &ldquo;six
horses were barely sufficient to draw a two-wheeled
vehicle fifteen miles in three
days.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The old time-tables of the Cumberland
Road make an interesting study. One of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the first of these published after the great
stage lines were in operation over the entire
road and the southern branch to Cincinnati,
appeared early in the year 1833. By this
schedule the Great Eastern Mail left Washington
daily at 7 P. M. and Baltimore at 9
P. M. and arrived in Wheeling, on the
Ohio River, in fifty-five hours. Leaving
Wheeling at 4:30 A. M., it arrived in
Columbus at five the morning following,
and in Cincinnati at the same hour the
next morning, making forty-eight hours
from one point on the river to the other,
much better time than any packet could
make. The Great Western Mail left
Cincinnati daily at 2 P. M. and reached
Columbus at 1 P. M. on the day following.
It left Columbus at 1:30 P. M. and reached
Wheeling at 2:30 P. M. the day following,
thence Washington in fifty-five hours.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>At times the mails on the Cumberland
Road were greatly delayed, taxing the
patience of the public beyond endurance.
The road itself was so well built that rain
had little effect upon it as a rule. In fact,
delay of the mails was more often due to
inefficiency of the Post Office Department,
inefficiency of the stage line service, or
failure of contractors, than poor roads.
Until a bridge was built across the Ohio
River at Wheeling, in 1836, mails often
became congested, especially when ice was
running out. There were frequent derangements
of cross and way mails which affected
seriously the efficiency of the service. The
vast number of connecting mails on the
Cumberland Road made regularity in transmission
of cross mails confusing, especially
if the through mails were at all irregular.</p>

<p>To us living in the present age of telegraphic
communication and the ubiquitous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
daily paper, it may not occur that the mail
stages of the old days were the newsboys
of the age, and that thousands looked to
their coming for the first word of news
from distant portions of the land. In times
of war or political excitement the express
mailstage and its precious load of papers
from Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York, was hailed as the latest editions of
our newspapers are today. Thus it must
have been that a greater proportion of the
population along the Cumberland Road
awaited with eager interest the coming of
the stage in the old days, than today await
the arrival of the long mail trains from the
east.</p>

<p>Late in the 30&rsquo;s and in the 40&rsquo;s, when
the mailstage system reached its highest
perfection, the mail and passenger service
had been entirely separated, special stages
being constructed for hauling the former.
As early as 1837 the Post Office Department
decreed that the mails, which heretofore
had always been held as of secondary consideration
compared with passengers, should
be carried in specially arranged vehicles,
into which the postmaster should put them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
under lock and key not to be opened until
the next post office was reached. These
stages were of two kinds, designed to be
operated upon routes where the mail ordinarily
comprised, respectively, a half and
nearly a whole load. In the former, room
was left for six passengers, in the latter,
for three. Including newspapers with the
regular mail, the later stages which ran
westward over the Cumberland Road rarely
carried passengers. Indeed there was
little room for the guards who traveled
with the driver to protect the government
property. Many old drivers of the &ldquo;Boston
Night Mail,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;New York Night
Mail,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Baltimore Mail,&rdquo; may yet be
found along the old road, who describe the
immense loads which they carried westward
behind flying steeds. Such a factor in the
mailstage business did the newspapers
become, that many contractors refused to
carry them by express mail, consigning
them to the ordinary mails, thereby bringing
down upon themselves the frequent
savage maledictions of a host of local
editors.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Newspapers were, nevertheless, carried
by express mailstages as far west as Ohio
in 1837, as is proved by a newspaper account
of a robbery committed on the Cumberland
Road, the robbers holding up an express
mailstage and finding nothing in it but
newspapers.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The mails on the Cumberland Road were
always in danger of being assailed by robbers,
especially on the mountainous portions
of the road at night. Though by dint of
lash and ready revolver the doughty drivers
usually came off safely with their charge.</p>

<h3>TAVERNS AND TAVERN LIFE</h3>


<p>So distinctive was the character of the
Cumberland Road that all which pertained
to it was highly characteristic.
Next to the race of men which grew up
beside its swinging stretches, nothing had
a more distinctive tone than the taverns
which offered cheer and hospitality to its
surging population.</p>

<p>The origin of taverns in the East was
very dissimilar from their history in the
West. The first taverns in the West were
those which did service on the old Braddock&rsquo;s
Road. Unlike the taverns of New
England, which were primarily drinking
places, sometimes closing at nine in the
evening, and not professing, originally, to
afford lodging, the tavern in the West arose
amid the forest to answer all the needs of
travelers. It may be said that every cabin
in all the western wilderness was a tavern,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
where, if there was a lack of &ldquo;bear and
cyder&rdquo; there was an abundance of dried
deer meat and Indian meal and a warm
fireplace before which to spread one&rsquo;s
blankets.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The first cabins on the old route from
the Potomac to the Ohio were at the Wills
Creek settlement (Cumberland) and Gist&rsquo;s
clearing, where Washington stopped on his
Le B&#339;uf trip on the buffalo trace not far
from the summit of Laurel Hill. After
Braddock&rsquo;s Road was built, and the first
roads were opened between Uniontown and
Brownsville, Washington and Wheeling,
during the Revolutionary period, a score
of taverns sprang up&mdash;the first of the kind
west of the Allegheny Mountains.</p>

<p>The oldest tavern on Braddock&rsquo;s Road
was Tomlinson&rsquo;s Tavern near &ldquo;Little
Meadows,&rdquo; eight miles west of the present
village of Frostburg, Maryland.</p>

<p>At this point the lines of Braddock&rsquo;s
Road and the Cumberland Road coincide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
On land owned by him along the old military
road Jesse Tomlinson erected a tavern.
When the Cumberland Road was built, his
first tavern was deserted and a new one
built near the old site. Another tavern,
erected by one Fenniken, stood on both the
line of the military road and the Cumberland
Road, two miles west of Smithfield
(&ldquo;Big Crossings&rdquo;) where the two courses
were identical.</p>

<p>The first taverns erected upon the road
which followed the portage path from
Uniontown to Brownsville were Collin&rsquo;s
Log Tavern and Rollin&rsquo;s Tavern, erected
in Uniontown in 1781 and 1783, respectively.
These taverns offered primitive
forms of hospitality to the growing stream
of sojourners over the rough mountain path
to the Youghiogheny at Brownsville, where
boats could be taken for the growing metropolis
of Pittsburg. Another tavern in the
West was located on this road ten miles
west of Uniontown. As the old century
neared its close a score of taverns sprang
up on the road from Uniontown to Brownsville
and on the road from Brownsville
to Wheeling. At least three old taverns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
are still remembered at West Brownsville.
Hill&rsquo;s stone tavern was erected at
Hillsboro in 1794. &ldquo;Catfish Camp,&rdquo; James
Wilson&rsquo;s tavern at Washington, the first
tavern in that historic town, was built in
1781 and operated eleven years for the
benefit of the growing tide of pioneers who
chose to embark on the Ohio at Wheeling
rather than on the Monongahela at Brownsville.
Other taverns at Washington before
1800 were McCormack&rsquo;s (1788), Sign of the
White Goose (1791), Buck Tavern (1796),
Sign of the Spread Eagle, and Globe Inn
(1797). The Gregg Tavern and the famous
old Workman House at Uniontown were
both erected in the last years of the old
century, 1797-1799. Two miles west of
Rankintown, Smith&rsquo;s Stone Tavern stood
on the road to Wheeling, and the Sign of
the American Eagle (1796) offered lodging
at West Alexander, several years before
the old century closed. West of the Ohio
River, on Zane&rsquo;s rough blazed track through
the scattered Ohio settlements toward Kentucky,
travelers found, as has been elsewhere
noted, entertainment at Zane&rsquo;s
clearings, at the fords of the Muskingum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and Scioto, and at the little settlement at
Cincinnati. Before the quarter of a century
elapsed ere the Cumberland Road crossed
the Ohio River, a number of taverns were
erected on the line of the road which was
built over the course of Zane&rsquo;s Trace. On
this first wagon-road west of the Ohio River
the earliest taverns were at St. Clairsville
and Zanesville. At this latter point the
road turned southwest, following Zane&rsquo;s
Trace to Lancaster, Chillicothe, and Maysville,
Kentucky. The first tavern on this
road was opened at Zanesville during the
last year of the old century, McIntire&rsquo;s
Hotel. In the winter of the same year,
1799, Green&rsquo;s Tavern was built, in which,
it is recorded, the Fourth of July celebration
in the following year was held.
Cordery&rsquo;s Tavern followed, and David Harvey
built a tavern in 1800. The first
license for a tavern in St. Clairsville was
issued to Jacob Haltz, February 23, 1802.
Two other licenses were issued that year
to John Thompson and Bazil Israel.
Barnes&rsquo;s Tavern was opened in 1803.
William Gibson, Michael Groves, Sterling
Johnson, Andrew Moore, and Andrew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Marshall kept tavern in the first half decade
of this century. As elsewhere noted, there
was no earlier road between Zanesville and
Columbus which the Cumberland Road
followed. West of Zanesville but one tavern
was opened in the first decade of this
century. Griffith Foos&rsquo;s tavern at Springfield,
which was doing business in 1801,
prospered until 1814. The other taverns
of the West, at Zanesville, Columbus,
Springfield, Richmond (Indiana), and Indianapolis,
are of another era and will be
mentioned later.</p>

<p>The first taverns of the West were built
mostly of logs, though a few, as noted, were
of stone. They were ordinary wilderness
cabins, rendered professionally hospitable
by stress of circumstance. They were
more often of but one or two rooms, where,
before the fireplace, guests were glad to
sleep together upon the puncheon floor.
The fare afforded was such as hunters
had&mdash;game from the surrounding forest
and neighboring streams and the product
of the little clearing, potatoes, and the
common cereals.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the new century a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
large number of substantial taverns arose
beside the first western roads&mdash;even before
the Cumberland Road was under way.
The best known of these were built at
Washington, The Sign of the Cross Keys
(1801), the McClellan (1802); and at Uniontown
the National and Walker Houses. At
Washington arose The Sign of the Golden
Swan (1806), Sign of the Green Tree (1808),
Gen. Andrew Jackson (1813), and Sign of
the Indian Queen (1815). These were built
in the age of sawmills and some of them
came well down through the century.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how many buildings are
to be seen on the Cumberland Road which
tell by their architectural form the story
of their fortunes. Many a tavern, outgrowing
the day of small things, was found
to be wholly inadequate to the greater business
of the new era. Additions were made
as circumstances demanded, and in some
cases the result is very interesting. The
Seaton House in Uniontown was built in
sections, as was the old Fulton House (now
Moran House) also of Uniontown. A fine
old stone tavern at Malden, Pennsylvania
was erected in 1822 and an addition made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
in 1830. A stone slab in the second section
bears the date &ldquo;1830,&rdquo; also the word
&ldquo;Liberty,&rdquo; and a rude drawing of a plow
and sheaf of wheat. Though of more
recent date, the well-known Four Mile
House west of Columbus, Ohio displays,
by a series of additions, the record of its
prosperous days, when the neighboring
Camp Chase held its population of Confederate
prisoners.</p>

<p>Among the more important taverns
which became the notable hostelries of the

<p>West of the Ohio were Rhode&rsquo;s and
McMahon&rsquo;s Taverns at Bridgeport; Hoo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ver&rsquo;s

of the Black Bear at Washington; Carran&rsquo;s,
McDonald&rsquo;s, McKinney&rsquo;s and Wilson&rsquo;s
Taverns in Guernsey County and the Ten
Mile House at Norwich, ten miles east of
Zanesville. In Zanesville, Robert Taylor
opened a tavern in 1805, and in 1807 moved
to the present site of the Clarendon Hotel,
situated on the Cumberland Road and hung
out the Sign of the Orange Tree. Perhaps
no tavern in the land can claim the honor
of holding a state legislature within its
doors, except the Sign of the Orange Tree,
where, in 1810-12, when Zanesville was the
temporary capital of Ohio, the legislature
made its headquarters.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The Sign of the
Rising Sun was another Zanesville tavern,
opened in 1806, the name being changed
by a later proprietor, without damage to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
its brilliancy, perhaps, to the Sign of the
Red Lion. The National Hotel was opened
in 1818 and became a famous hostelry.
Roger&rsquo;s Hotel is mentioned in many old
advertisements for bids for making and
repairing the Cumberland Road. In 1811
William Burnham opened the Sign of the
Merino Lamb in a frame building owned
by General Isaac Van Horne. The Sign
of the Green Tree was opened by John S.
Dugan in 1817, this being remembered for
entertaining President Monroe, and General
Lewis Cass at a later date. West of
Zanesville, on the new route opened
straight westward to Columbus, the famous
monumental pile of stone, the Five Mile
House long served its useful purpose beside
the road and is one of the most impressive
of its monuments, today. Edward Smith
and Usal Headley were early tavern-keepers
at this point. Henry Winegamer built
a tavern three miles west of the Five Mile
House. Henry Hursey built and opened
the first tavern at Gratiot. These public
houses west of Zanesville were erected in
the year preceding the opening of the
Cumberland Road, which was built through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the forest in the year 1831.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The stages
which were soon running from Zanesville
to Columbus, left the uncompleted, line of
the Cumberland Road at Jacksontown and
struck across to Newark and followed the
old road thence to Columbus. The first
tavern built in Columbus was opened in
1813, which, in 1816, bore the sign &ldquo;The
Lion and the Eagle.&rdquo; After 1817 it was
known as &ldquo;The Globe.&rdquo; The Columbus
Inn and White Horse Tavern were early
Columbus hotels; Pike&rsquo;s Tavern was
opened in 1822, and a tavern bearing the
sign of the Golden Lamb was opened in
1825. The Neil House was opened in the
twenties, a transfer of it to new owners
appearing in local papers in 1832. It was
the headquarters of the Neil, Moore, and
Company line of stages and the best known
early tavern in the old coaching days in
Ohio. Many forgotten taverns in Columbus
can be found mentioned in old documents
and papers, including the famous
American House, Buckeye Hotel, on the
present site of the Board of Trade building,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
etc. West of Columbus the celebrated
Four Mile House, which has been referred
to previously, was erected in the latter half
of the century. In the days of the great
mail and stage lines Billy Werden&rsquo;s Tavern
in Springfield was the leading hostelry in
western Ohio. At this point the stages
running to Cincinnati, with mail for the
Mississippi Valley, left the Cumberland
Road. Across the state line, Neal&rsquo;s and
Clawson&rsquo;s Taverns offered hospitality in
the extreme eastern border of Indiana. At
Richmond, Starr Tavern (Tremont Hotel),
Nixon&rsquo;s Tavern, Gilbert&rsquo;s two-story, pebble-coated
tavern and Bayle&rsquo;s Sign of the
Green Tree, offered entertainment worthy
of the road and its great business, while
Sloan&rsquo;s brick stagehouse accommodated
the passenger traffic of the stage lines. At
Indianapolis, the Palmer House, built in
1837, and Washington Hall, welcomed the
public of the two great political faiths,
Democrat and Whig, respectively.</p>

<p>At almost every mile of the road&rsquo;s long
length, wagonhouses offered hospitality to
the hundreds engaged in the great freight
traffic. Here a large room with its fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>place
could be found before which to lay
blankets on a winter&rsquo;s night. The most
successful wagonhouses were situated at
the outskirts of the larger towns, where, at
more reasonable prices and in more congenial
surroundings than in a crowded city
inn, the rough sturdy men upon whom the
whole West depended for over a generation
for its merchandise, found hospitable entertainment
for themselves and their rugged
horses. These houses were usually unpretentious
frame buildings surrounded by a
commodious yard, and generous watering-troughs
and barns. A hundred tired horses
have been heard munching their corn in a
single wagonhouse yard at the end of a long
day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>In both tavern and wagonhouse the fireplace
and the bar were always present,
whatever else might be missing. The fireplaces
in the first western taverns were
notably generous, as the rigorous winters
of the Alleghenies required. Many of these
fireplaces were seven feet in length and
nearly as high, capable of holding, had it
been necessary, a wagonload of wood.
With a great fireplace at the end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
room, lighting up its darkest corners as no
candle could, the taverns along the Cumberland
Road where the stages stopped for
the night, saw merrier scenes than any of
their modern counterparts witness. And
over all their merry gatherings the flames
from the great fires threw a softened light,
in which those who remember them best
seem to bask as they tell us of them. The
taverns near some of the larger villages,
Wheeling, Washington, or Uniontown,
often entertained for a winter&rsquo;s evening, a
sleighing party from town, to whom the
great room and its fireplace were surrendered
for the nonce, where soon lisping
footsteps and the soft swirl of old-fashioned
skirts told that the dance was on.</p>

<p>Beside the old fireplace hung two important
articles, the flip-iron and the poker.
The poker used in the old road taverns was
of a size commensurate with the fireplace,
often being seven or eight feet long. Each
landlord was Keeper-of-the-Poker in his
own tavern, and many were particular that
none but themselves should touch the
great fire, which was one of the main features
of their hospitality, after the quality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of the food and drink. Eccentric old
&ldquo;Boss&rdquo; Rush in his famous tavern near
Smithfield (Big Crossings) even kept his
poker under lock and key.</p>

<p>The tavern signs so common in New
England were known only in the earlier
days of the Cumberland Road as many of
the tavern names show. The majority of
the great taverns bore on their signs only
the name of their proprietor, the earliest
landlord&rsquo;s name often being used for several
generations. The advancing of the
century can be noticed in the origin of such
names as the National House, the United
States Hotel, the American House, etc.
The evolution in nomenclature is, plainly,
from the sign or symbol to the landlord&rsquo;s
name, then to a fanciful name. Another
sign of later days was the building of verandas.
The oldest taverns now standing
are plain ones or the two story buildings
rising abruptly from the pavement and
opening directly upon it. Of this type is
the Brownfield House at Uniontown and
numerous half-forgotten houses which were
early taverns in Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p>

<p>The kitchen of the old inn was an im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>portant
feature, especially as many of the
taverns were little more than restaurants
where stage-passengers hastily dined.
The food provided was of a plain and
nourishing character, including the famous
home-cured hams, which Andrew Jackson
preferred, and the buckwheat cakes, which
Henry Clay highly extolled. In this connection
it should be said that the women of
the old West were most successful in operating
the old-time taverns, and many of
the best &ldquo;stands&rdquo; were conducted by
them. The provision made in a license to
a woman in early New England, that &ldquo;she
provide a fit man that is godly to manage
the business,&rdquo; was never suggested in the
West, where hundreds of brave women
carried on the business of their husbands
after their decease. And their heroism
was appreciated and remembered by the
gallant aristocracy of the road.</p>

<p>The old Revolutionary soldiers who,
quite generally, became the landlords of
New England, did not keep tavern in the
West. But one Revolutionary veteran was
landlord on the Cumberland Road. The
road bred and brought up its own landlords<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
to a large extent. The early landlords
were fit men to rule in the early taverns,
and provided from forest and stream the
larger portion of food for the travelers over
the first rough roads. It is said that these
objected to the building of the Cumberland
Road, through fear that more accelerated
means of locomotion would eventually
cheat them out of the business which then
fell to their share.</p>

<p>But, like the New England landlord, the
western tavern-keeper was a many-sided
man. Had the Cumberland Road taverns
been located always within villages, their
proprietors might have become what New
England landlords are reputed to have
been, town representatives, councilmen,
selectmen, tapsters, and heads of the
&ldquo;Train Band&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, next to the town
clerk in importance. As it was, the western
landlord often filled as important a
position on the frontier as his eastern counterpart
did in New England. This was
due, in part, to the place which the western
tavern occupied in society. Taverns were,
both in the East and in the West, places of
meeting for almost any business. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
was particularly true in the West, where
the public house was almost the only available
place for any gathering whatever
between the scattered villages. But while
in the East the landlord was most frequently
busy with official duties, the
western landlord was mostly engaged in
collateral professions, which rendered him
of no less value to his community. The
jovial host at the Cumberland Road tavern
often worked a large farm, upon which his
tavern stood. Some of the more prosperous
on the eastern half of the road, owned
slaves who carried on the work of the farm
and hotel. He sometimes ran a store in
connection with his tavern, and almost
without exception, officiated at his bar,
where he &ldquo;sold strong waters to relieve
the inhabitants.&rdquo; Whiskey, two drinks for
a &ldquo;fippenny bit,&rdquo; called &ldquo;fip&rdquo; for short
(value six and a quarter cents) was the
principal &ldquo;strong water&rdquo; in demand. It
was the pure article, neither diluted nor
adulterated. In the larger towns of course
any beverage of the day was kept at the
taverns&mdash;sherry toddy, mulled wine, madeira,
and cider.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>As has been said, the road bred its own
landlords. Youths, whose lives began
simultaneously with that of the great road,
worked upon its curved bed in their teens,
became teamsters and contractors in middle
life, and spent the autumn of their lives as
landlords of its taverns, purchased with
the money earned in working upon it.
Several well-known landlords were prominent
contractors, many of whom owned
their share of the great six- and eight-horse
teams which hauled freight to the
western rivers.</p>

<p>The old taverns were the hearts of the
Cumberland Road, and the tavern life was
the best gauge to measure the current of
business that ebbed and flowed. As the
great road became superseded by the railways,
the taverns were the first to succumb
to the shock. In a very interesting article,
a recent writer on &ldquo;The Rise of the Tide
of Life to New England Hilltops,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> speaks
of the early hill life of New England, and
the memorials there left &ldquo;of the deep and
sweeping streams of human history.&rdquo; The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
author would have found the Cumberland
Road and its predecessors an interesting
western example of the social phenomena
with which he dealt. In New England,
as in the Central West, the first traveled
courses were on the summits of the watersheds.
These routes of the brute were the
first ways of men. The tide of life has
ebbed from New England hilltops since the
beginning. Sufficient is it for the present
subject that the Cumberland Road was the
most important &ldquo;stream of human history&rdquo;
from Atlantic tide-water to the headwaters
of the streams of the Mississippi. Its old
taverns are, after the remnants of the historic
roadbed and ponderous bridges, the
most interesting &ldquo;shells and fossils&rdquo; cast
up by this stream. This old route, chosen
first by the buffalo and followed by red men
and white men, will ever be the course of
travel across the mountains. From this
rugged path made by the once famous Cumberland
Road, the tide of life cannot ebb.
Here, a thousand years hence, may course
a magnificent boulevard, the American
Appian Way, to the commercial, as well as
military, key of the eastern slopes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Mississippi Basin at the junction of the
Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. It is
important that each fact of history concerning
this ancient highway be put on lasting
record.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>It is impossible to leave the study of the
Cumberland Road without gathering
up into a single chapter a number of
threads which have not been woven into
the preceding record. And first, the very
appearance of the old road as seen by travelers
who pass over it today. One cannot
go a single mile over it without becoming
deeply impressed with the evidence of the
age and the individuality of the old Cumberland
Road. There is nothing like it in
the United States. Leaping the Ohio at
Wheeling, the Cumberland Road throws
itself across Ohio and Indiana, straight as
an arrow, like an ancient elevated pathway
of the gods, chopping hills in twain at a
blow, traversing the lowlands on high
grades like a railroad bed, vaulting river
and stream on massive bridges of unparalleled
size. The farther one travels upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
it, the more impressed one must become,
for there is, in the long grades and stretches
and ponderous bridges, that &ldquo;masterful
suggestion of a serious purpose, speeding
you along with a strange uplifting of the
heart,&rdquo; of which Kenneth Grahame speaks;
&ldquo;and even in its shedding off of bank and
hedgerow as it marched straight and full
for the open downs, it seems to declare its
contempt for adventitious trappings to catch
the shallow-pated.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> For long distances,
this road &ldquo;of the sterner sort&rdquo; will be, so
far as its immediate surface is concerned,
what the tender mercies of the counties
through which it passes will allow, but at
certain points, the traveler comes out unexpectedly
upon the ancient roadbed, for in
many places the old macadamized bed is
still doing noble duty.</p>

<p>Nothing is more striking than the ponderous
stone bridges which carry the roadbed
over the waterways. It is doubtful if
there are on this continent such monumental
relics of the old stone bridge builders&rsquo;
art. Not only such massive bridges
as those at Big Crossings (Smithfield, Penn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>sylvania)
and the artistic &ldquo;S&rdquo; bridge near
Claysville, Pennsylvania, will attract the
traveler&rsquo;s attention, but many of the less
pretentious bridges over brooks and rivulets
will, upon examination, be found to be
ponderous pieces of workmanship. A pregnant
suggestion of the change which has
come over the land can be read in certain
of these smaller bridges and culverts.
When the great road was built the land was
covered with forests and many drains were
necessary. With the passing of the forests
many large bridges, formerly of much
importance, are now of a size out of all
proportion to the demand for them, and
hundreds of little bridges have fallen into
disuse, some of them being quite above the
general level of the surrounding fields.
The ponderous bridge at Big Crossings was
finished and dedicated with great &eacute;clat July
4, 1818. Near the eastern end of the three
fine arches is the following inscription:
&ldquo;Kinkead, Beck &amp; Evans, builders, July
4, 1818.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">Culvert on the Cumberland Road in Ohio</span>
</div>

<p>The traveler will notice still the mileposts
which mark the great road&rsquo;s successive
steps. Those on the eastern portion of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
road are of iron and were made at the
foundries at Connellsville and Brownsville.
Major James Francis had the contract for
making and delivering those between Cumberland
and Brownsville. John Snowdan
had the contract for those between Brownsville
and Wheeling. They were hauled in
six-horse teams to their sites. Those
between Brownsville and Cumberland have
recently been reset and repainted. The
milestones west of the Ohio River are
mostly of sandstone, and are fast disappearing
under the action of the weather. Some
are quite illegible though the word &ldquo;Cumberland&rdquo;
at the top can yet be read on
almost all. In central Ohio, through the
Darby woods, or &ldquo;Darby Cuttings,&rdquo; the
mileposts have been greatly mutilated by
vandal woodchoppers, who knocked off
large chips with which to sharpen their
axes.</p>

<p>The bed of the Cumberland Road was
originally eighty feet in width. In Ohio at
least, property owners have encroached upon
the road until, in some places, ten feet of
ground has been included within the fences.
This matter has been brought into notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
where franchises for electric railway lines
have been granted. In Franklin County,
west of Columbus, Ohio, there is hardly
room for a standard gauge track outside
the roadbed, where once the road occupied
forty feet each side of its axis. When the
property owners were addressed with
respect to the removal of their fences, they
demanded to be shown quitclaim deeds for
the land, which, it is unnecessary to say,
were not forthcoming from the state. Hundreds
of contracts, calling for a width of
eighty feet, can be given as evidence of the
original width of the road.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In days when
it was considered the most extraordinary
good fortune to have the Cumberland Road
pass through one&rsquo;s farm, it was not considered
necessary to obtain quitclaim deeds
for the land.</p>

<p>It is difficult to sufficiently emphasize the
aristocracy which existed among the old
&ldquo;pike boys,&rdquo; as those most intimately connected
with the road were called. This
was particularly true of the drivers of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
mail and passenger stages, men who were
as often noted for their quick wit and large
acquaintance with men as for their dexterous
handling of two hands full of reins.
Their social and business position was the
envy of the youth of a nation, whose
ambition to emulate them was begotten of
the best sort of hero-worship. Stage-drivers&rsquo;
foibles were their pet themes, such
as the use of peculiar kinds of whips and
various modes of driving. Of the latter
there were three styles common to the
Cumberland Road, (1) The flat rein (English
style), (2) Top and bottom (Pennsylvania
adaptation), (3) Side rein (Eastern
style). The last mode was in commonest
use. Of drivers there were of course all
kinds, slovenly, cruel, careful. Of the best
class, John Bunting, Jim Reynolds, and
Billy Armor were best known, after &ldquo;Red&rdquo;
Bunting, in the east, and David Gordon
and James Burr, on the western division.
No one was more proud of the fine horses
which did the work of the great road than
the better class of drivers. As Thackeray
said was true in England, the passing of
the era of good roads and the mailstage has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
sounded the knell of the rugged race of horses
which once did service in the Central West.</p>

<p>As one scans the old files of newspapers,
or reads old-time letters and memoirs of
the age of the Cumberland Road, he is
impressed with the interest taken in the
coming and going of the more renowned
guests of the old road. The passage of a
president-elect over the Cumberland Road
was a triumphant procession. The stage
companies made special stages, or selected
the best of their stock, in which to bear
him. The best horses were fed and
groomed for the proud task. The most
noted drivers were appointed to the honorable
station of Charioteer-to-the-President.
The thousands of homes along his route
were decked in his honor, and welcoming
heralds rode out from the larger towns to
escort their noted guests to celebrations for
which preparations had been making for
days in advance. The slow-moving presidential
pageant through Ohio and Pennsylvania
was an educational and patriotic
ceremony, of not infrequent occurrence in
the old coaching days&mdash;a worthy exhibition
which hardly has its counterpart in these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
days of steam. Jackson, Van Buren, Monroe,
Harrison, Polk, and Tyler passed in
triumph over portions of the great road.
The taverns at which they were f&ecirc;ted are
remembered by the fact. Drivers who
were chosen for the task of driving their
coach were ever after noted men. But
there were other guests than presidents-elect,
though none received with more
acclaim. Henry Clay, the champion of the
road, was a great favorite throughout its
towns and hamlets, one of which, Claysville,
proudly perpetuates his name.
Benton and Cass, General Lafayette, General
Santa Anna, Black Hawk, Jenny Lind,
P. T. Barnum, and John Quincy Adams
are all mentioned in the records of the
stirring days of the old road. As has been
suggested elsewhere, politics entered
largely into the consideration of the building
and maintenance of the road. Enemies
of internal improvement were not forgotten
as they passed along the great road which
they voted to neglect, as even Martin Van
Buren once realized when the axle of his
coach was sawed in two, breaking down
where the mud was deepest. Many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
episodes are remembered, indicating that
all the political prejudice and rancor known
elsewhere was especially in evidence on
this highway, which owed its existence
and future to the machinations of politicians.</p>

<p>But the greatest blessing of the Cumberland
Road was the splendid era of growth
which it did its share toward hastening.
Its best friends could see in its decline and
decay only evidences of unhappiest fortune,
while in reality the great road had done its
noble work and was to be superseded by
better things which owed to it their coming.
Historic roads there had been, before
this great highway of America was built,
but none in all the past had been the means
of supplanting themselves by greater and
more efficient means of communication.
The far-famed Appian Way witnessed
many triumphal processions of consuls and
proconsuls, but it never was the means of
bringing into existence something to take
its place in a new and more progressive
era. It helped to create no free empire at
its extremity, and they who traversed it
in so much pride and power would find it
today nothing but a ponderous memorial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of their vanity. The Cumberland Road
was built by the people and for the people,
and served well its high purpose. It
became a highway for the products of the
factories, the fisheries and the commerce
of the eastern states. It made possible
that interchange of the courtesies of social
life necessary in a republic of united states.
It was one of the great strands which
bound the nation together in early days
when there was much to excite animosity
and provoke disunion. It became the pride
of New England as well as of the West
which it more immediately benefited;
&ldquo;The state of which I am a citizen,&rdquo; said
Edward Everett at Lexington, Kentucky,
in 1829, &ldquo;has already paid between one
and two thousand dollars toward the construction
and repair of that road; and I
doubt not she is prepared to contribute her
proportion toward its extension to the place
of its destination.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of ancient but unpretentious
monuments of the Cumberland Road&mdash;the
hoary milestones which line it&mdash;stand to
perpetuate its name in future days. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
were they all gathered together&mdash;from
Indiana and Ohio and Pennsylvania and
Virginia and Maryland&mdash;and cemented into
a monstrous pyramid, the pile would not be
inappropriate to preserve the name and fame
of a highway which &ldquo;carried thousands of
population and millions of wealth into the
West; and more than any other material
structure in the land, served to harmonize
and strengthen, if not save, the Union.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What of the future? The dawning of
the era of country living is in sight. It is
being hastened by the revolution in methods
of locomotion. The bicycle and automobile
presage an era of good roads, and
of an unparalleled countryward movement
of society. With this era is coming the
revival of inn and tavern life, the rejuvenation
of a thousand ancient highways and
all the happy life that was ever known
along their dusty stretches. By its position
with reference to the national capital, and
the military and commercial key of the
Central West, Pittsburg, and both of the
great cities of Ohio, the Cumberland Road
will become, perhaps, the foremost of the
great roadways of America. The bed is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
capable of being made substantial at a
comparatively small cost, as the grading is
quite perfect. Its course measures the
shortest possible route practicable for a
roadway from tidewater to the Mississippi
River. As a trunk line its location cannot
be surpassed. Its historic associations will
render the route of increasing interest to
the thousands who, in other days, will
travel, in the genuine sense of the word,
over those portions of its length which long
ago became hallowed ground. The
&ldquo;Shades of Death&rdquo; will again be filled
with the echoing horn which heralded the
arrival of the old-time coaches, and Winding
Ridge again be crowded with the traffic
of a nation. A hundred Cumberland Road
taverns will be opened, and bustling landlords
welcome, as of yore, the travel-stained
visitor. Merry parties will again
fill those tavern halls, now long silent,
with their laughter.</p>

<p>And all this will but mark a new and
better era than its predecessor, an era of
outdoor living, which must come, and come
quickly, if as a nation we are to retain our
present hold on the world&rsquo;s great affairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

route of the road shows plainly that it was really built
for the benefit of the Chillicothe and Cincinnati settlements,
which embraced a large portion of Ohio&rsquo;s
population. The opening of river traffic in the first two
decades of the century, however, had the effect of
throwing the line of the road further northward through
the capitals of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Zane&rsquo;s
Trace, diverging from the Cumberland Road at Zanesville,
played an important part in the development of
southwestern Ohio, becoming the course of the Lancaster
and Maysville Pike. See <i>Historic Highways of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Concerning the celerity of opening the road after the
completion of contracts, Captain Weaver, Superintendent
in Ohio, made the following statement in his report
of 1827:
</p><p>
&ldquo;Upon the first, second and third divisions, with a
cover of metal of six inches in thickness, composed of
stone reduced to particles of not more than four ounces
in weight, the travel was admitted in the month of June
last. Those divisions that lie eastward of the village
of Fairview together embrace a distance of very nearly
twenty-eight and a half miles, and were put under contract
on the first of July, and first and thirty-first of
August, 1825. This portion of the road has been, in
pursuance of contracts made last fall and spring, covered
with the third stratum of metal of three inches in thickness,
and similarly reduced. On parts of this distance,
say about five miles made up of detached pieces, the
travel was admitted at the commencement of the last
winter and has continued on to this time to render it
compact and solid; it is very firm, elastic and smooth.
The effect has been to dissipate the prejudices which
existed very generally, in the minds of the citizens,
against the McAdam system, and to establish full confidence
over the former plan of constructing roads.
</p><p>
&ldquo;On the first day of July, the travel was admitted
upon the fourth and fifth divisions, and upon the second,
third, fourth, and fifth sections of the sixth division of
the road, in its graduated state. This part of the line
was put under contract on the eleventh day of September,
1826, terminating at a point three miles west of
Cambridge, and embraces a distance of twenty-three
and a half miles. On the twenty-first of July the balance
of the line to Zanesville, comprising a distance
of a little over twenty-one miles, was let.&rdquo;</p></div>
